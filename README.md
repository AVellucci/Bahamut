PCGen Data Sets


This is for my growing collection of PCGen compatible books. This is meant to be as compatible with the existing PCGen data sets, and to that end you'll notice a lot of common usages to avoid any non-compatibility.

For that reason, I'm also redoing the Main Books - Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide and Monster Manual to include what PCGen is missing from their sets.

My group prefers the non-rsrd material and that is what I plan on giving them.

I'm willing to collaborate with anyone desiring to grow this collection of mine. :)
