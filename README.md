PCGen Data Sets & Homebrew

Mates! This is for my growing collection of PCGen compatible books. (http://pcgen.org)


Orginally this was meant to be as compatible with the existing PCGen book data sets. To achieve that, I attempt to re-use a lot of common pcgen standards to avoid any non-compatibility.


I've remade the 3.5 books, including the core rulebooks to include what PCGen is missing from their sets due to OGL issues.


My own gaming group prefers the complete non-rsrd materials and that is what I plan on giving them. I code up what we need or what is requested.
I'm willing to collaborate with anyone desiring to grow this collection of mine. I would certainly appreciate any help from fellow homebrewers. Any experience level is welcome. I can always use help testing the books, or if you have a little knowledge, going in and coding in the minor things.


I also made a discussion group for homebrewers, share ideas and of course make requests -- http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/bd_games/


Best,
