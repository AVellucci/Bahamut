Loresong Faen Racial Traits

#. Faen are light-footed and quiet when they wish to be, earning them a +2 racial bonus on Sneak checks.

#. Metamorphosis: A faen of at least 3rd character level (in any class[es]) may choose to undergo a metamorphosis. This can occur only at a time when the character normally would gain a new or bonus feat-the metamorphosis is in lieu of the feat. The faen secretes a sticky substance that she wraps around herself. The secretion hardens, forming a chrysalis. The faen then spends 1d4+3 days in the chrysalis, after which she emerges in a completely different form. Even smaller than before, the faen now has gossamer wings that can carry her aloft. She has become a spryte. A faen's gear taken into the magical chrysalis emerges sized appropriately for the character's new stature.

#. Tiny: Because they are Tiny creatures, sprytes gain a +2 size bonus to Armor Class and attack rolls (instead of the +1 bonus they had while Small), and a +8 size bonus to all Sneak checks (instead of the +4 bonus they had while Small). They must use Tiny-sized weapons and equipment and can lift and carry only half as much as Medium characters.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The akashic is proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons and heavy, medium, and light armors and shields.
Skill Memory (Su): Akashics can reach into the collective memory and gain insight into a needed skill-even one in which the character has no ranks and cannot use untrained (but not a language). After a full round of concentration, the akashic gains a +2 bonus to a single skill check attempt made the next round. The akashic can use skill memory once per day per two akashic levels (once per day at 1st through 3rd level, twice per day at 4th and 5th levels, three times per day at 6th and 7th levels, and so on). At 9th level, this bonus becomes +4. At 17th level, it is +6. At 25th level it is +8.
Perfect Recall (Ex): By 2nd level, akashics have honed their own memories. To any Knowledge skill check that they make without using skill memory (thus relying on their own memory), they add their Intelligence bonus, if any, to the skill bonus again. Thus, an akashic with 5 ranks of Knowledge (history) and a +2 Intelligence bonus has a skill bonus of +9 (5 + 2 + 2) using perfect recall. Akashics without an Intelligence bonus gain nothing from this ability. The akashic also can add double his Intelligence bonus if the DM calls for an Intelligence check to remember something. Intelligent akashics can use this ability to memorize vast amounts of information, which they can recall at a moment's notice.
Delve Into Collective Memory (Su): An akashic may make a special check with a bonus equal to his level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. This takes 10 minutes and can be attempted once per day per class level. (For some reason, akashics have trouble obtaining information about runechildren. No one knows why.) This check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. The akashic may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random. The DM determines the Difficulty Class of the check by referring to the table below.

Minor Akashic Ability: At 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th level, the akashic can choose one of the following abilities. No minor ability may be selected more than once.
#
Bonus Feat (Ex): The akashic gains an additional general, ceremonial, or item creation feat of his choosing. If he selects a ceremonial feat, he need not go through the ceremony (or pay for it); even Unbound characters can gain ceremonial feats this way. However, he must still meet all bonus feat prerequisites, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums and prerequisite feats (but not truenames).
Creature Loresight (Sp): An akashic can use the spell creature loresight a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence bonus as a spell-like ability. If he does not have an Intelligence bonus, he can use this ability once per week.
Kinesthetic Memory (Su): An akashic's sensory memory is so precise that he can easily get around with no penalty when he has a single damaged or deprived sense and is in familiar surroundings. For example, a blind akashic can move about in his home, a clothing shop he frequents, or inside a castle he has viewed extensively with magic, operating with no penalties. Lesser Learn Secret (Sp): An akashic can use the spell lesser learn secret once per day.

SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Minor Battle Memory (Su): Calling upon the knowledge of the greatest warriors who have ever lived, the akashic can concentrate for 1 round. Afterward, for 1 round per class level, he gains a +3 competence bonus to attack and damage rolls, as well as a +3 dodge bonus to Armor Class. An akashic can use minor battle memory once per day.
Object Loresight (Sp): An akashic can use the object loresight spell a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence bonus as a spell-like ability. If he has no Intelligence bonus, he can use this ability once per week.
Skill Focus (Ex): The akashic focuses on one particular skill and gains a permanent, inherent +4 bonus in that skill.
Sneak Attack (Ex): Using the akashic memory to remember the vital spots of other creatures, an akashic can make devastating attacks. Any time the akashic's target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the akashic flanks the target, the akashic's attack deals +1d6 extra points of damage. Should the character score a critical hit with a sneak attack, do not multiply this extra damage. The akashic can make sneak attacks with ranged weapons, but only up to a range of 30 feet.
Tongues (Sp): Akashics can use the tongues spell once per day.
Lesser Akashic Ability: At 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th, and 14th level, the akashic can choose one of the following abilities. No lesser ability may be selected more than once.
Bonus Feat (Ex): The akashic gains an additional general, ceremonial, or item creation feat of his choosing. If he selects a ceremonial feat, he need not go through the ceremony (or pay for it); even Unbound characters can gain ceremonial feats this way. However, he must still meet all bonus feat prerequisites, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums and prerequisite feats (but not truenames).
Defensive Focus (Ex): The akashic trains, using his knowledge of famous battles and the memories of expert fighters, to defend himself well. He gains a permanent +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class and +1 competence bonus to all saving throws.
Lesser Delve Into Personal Memory (Su): An akashic can mentally probe the memory of one other creature within 25 feet. The akashic mentally forms a question the creature can answer with a single word. No shared language is needed, nor does it matter whether the creature is conscious or aware. The creature can make a Will save (DC 10 + half akashic's class level + the akashic's Charisma modifier). If the creature fails its save, the akashic gains the answer as if the creature mentally answered the question as truthfully as possible. In any event, the creature does not know the akashic made the attempt. A character can use this ability once per day as a standard action.
Impersonate (Su): Using his ability to delve into the memories of others, the akashic can impersonate other living creatures' mannerisms, speech patterns, knowledge, and overall demeanor, adding a +5 bonus to Disguise checks. The akashic can use this ability at will, although he must have been within 25 feet of the creature to be impersonated at some point before he can use the ability. The creature gains no sense that the akashic is impersonating him.
Greater Learn Secret (Sp): An akashic can use the greater learn secret spell once per day.

SOURCEPAGE:p.42
Lesser Battle Memory (Su): Calling upon the knowledge of the greatest warriors who have ever lived, the akashic can concentrate for 1 round. Afterward, for 1 round per class level, he gains a +4 competence bonus to attack and damage rolls, as well as a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class. An akashic can use lesser battle memory twice per day.
Location Loresight (Sp): The akashic can use the location loresight spell a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence bonus as a spell-like ability. If he has no Intelligence bonus, he can use this ability once per week.
Modify Memory (Sp): An akashic can use the modify memory spell once per day.
Skill Focus (Ex): The akashic focuses on one particular skill and gains a permanent, inherent +4 bonus in that skill.
Sneak Attack (Ex): Using the akashic memory to remember the vital spots of other creatures, an akashic can make devastating attacks. Any time the akashic's target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the akashic flanks the target, the akashic's attack deals +1d6 extra points of damage. Should the character score a critical hit with a sneak attack, do not multiply this extra damage. The akashic can make sneak attacks with ranged weapons, but only up to a range of 30 feet. If the akashic took sneak attack as a minor akashic ability or gained the ability to make sneak attacks elsewhere (such as through unfettered class levels), the extra damage stacks.
#
Feat Memory (Su): At 12th level and beyond, an akashic can reach into the collective memory and produce an ability normally gained as a general feat. The akashic must meet the prerequisites of the feat. After a full round of concentration, the akashic can use the feat ability as though he possessed it for 1 round per class level. The akashic can use this ability once per day.
Greater Akashic Ability: At 15th, 16th, 18th, and 19th level, the akashic can choose one of the following abilities. No greater ability may be chosen more than once.
Bonus Feat (Ex): The akashic gains an additional general, ceremonial, or item creation feat of his choosing. If he selects a ceremonial feat, he need not go through the ceremony (or pay for it); even Unbound characters can gain ceremonial feats in this way. However, he must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums and prerequisite feats (but not truenames).
Greater Battle Memory (Su): Calling upon the knowledge of the greatest warriors who have ever lived, the akashic can concentrate for 1 round. Afterward, for 1 round per class level, he gains a +5 competence bonus to attack and damage rolls, as well as a +5 dodge bonus to Armor Class. An akashic can use greater battle memory three times per day.
Greater Delve Into Personal Memory (Su): An akashic can mentally probe the memory of one other creature within 25 feet. The akashic mentally forms a question the creature can answer with up to one word per akashic level in length. No shared language is needed, nor does it matter whether the creature is conscious or aware. The creature can make a Will save (DC 10 + half akashic's class level + the akashic's Charisma modifier). If the creature fails its save, the akashic gains the answer as if the creature mentally answered the question as truthfully as possible. In any event, the creature does not know the akashic made the attempt. A character can use this ability once per day as a standard action.
Memory Possession (Su): The akashic can absorb the memories of any intelligent creature who is alive or who has ever lived for 1 round per level. During this time, the creature's personality takes control of the akashic's body. Akashics use this ability to allow their allies to speak with and ask questions of the possessing memory (often that of an ancestor, absent friend, or other wellknown figure). If the possessing memory seeks to say or do something against the akashic's will, the akashic may attempt a Will saving throw (DC 20) to prevent it. This ability can be used once per day.
Skill Focus (Ex): The akashic focuses on one particular skill and gains a permanent, inherent +4 bonus in it.
Sneak Attack (Ex): Using the akashic memory to remember the vital spots of other creatures, an akashic can make devastating attacks. Any time the akashic's target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the akashic flanks the target, the akashic's attack deals +1d6 extra points of damage. Should the character score a critical hit with a sneak attack, do not multiply this extra damage. The akashic can make sneak attacks with ranged weapons, but only up to a range of 30 feet. If the akashic took sneak attack as a minor and/or lesser akashic ability, or gained the ability to make sneak attacks elsewhere (such as through unfettered class levels), the extra damage stacks.
Steal Identity (Su): The akashic can impersonate any intelligent creature who is alive or has ever lived without ever having been near that creature. Steal identity functions like the impersonate ability, except with a +10 bonus to Disguise checks. This ability functions for one hour for every four class levels the akashic has. He can use it once per day.
#
Spell Memory (Su): Starting at 20th level, an akashic can delve into the collective memory once per day to learn how to cast one simple spell of 7th level or lower once. He must have an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the spell's level in order to cast it. The akashic uses his class level as the caster level and Intelligence as the key ability. This ability can be used once per day at any time during the day. At 21st level, the akashic can use this ability twice per day.
SOURCEPAGE:p.43
Momentary Memory Ability: At 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 24th level, the akashic can choose one of the following abilities. These abilities all stem from the high-level akashic character's ability to look into very recent memories on a moment's notice. An akashic may not select any momentary memory ability more than once.
#
Memory of One's Own Thoughts (Su): The akashic can look into the moments-old memories of a creature's thoughts, effectively reading the creature's thoughts only a fraction of a second after the creature has them. The akashic can use the spell read mind at will on any creature within 25 feet as a free action. The ability can be used once per round and only on one creature's mind at once.
Memory of One's Own Intentions (Su): The akashic can know the moments-old memories of a creature's intentions in combat, whether he swings low or high or stabs with a quick thrust. The akashic gains a +5 insight bonus to Armor Class against all attacks he is aware of made by one foe within 100 feet. Using this ability is a free action.
Memory of One's Own Spells (Su): The akashic can know the moments-old memories of a creature's spellcasting. This grants him a +5 insight bonus to saving throws against all spells cast upon him by one foe he is aware of within 100 feet. Further, a number of times each day equal to his Intelligence bonus, he can ready an action to automatically counter any spell cast within 100 feet. Akashics with no bonus to Intelligence can use this ability once per week. Using this ability is a free action.
Memory of One's Own Presence (Su): By reading the momentsold memories of all near him, the akashic has perfect knowledge of the exact location of any thinking being within 30 feet. Within that range, invisible and hidden foes are revealed to the akashic. The akashic cannot be flanked and never loses his Dexterity bonus to attacks from foes within 30 feet. Using this ability is a free action.
Memory of One's Own Weakness (Su): The akashic can know the moments-old memories of a creature's thoughts in combat, granting him a +2 insight bonus to all attack and damage rolls if the foe is within 30 feet. Further, the akashic always treats foes within 30 feet as if they have no Dexterity bonus. Akashics with the sneak attack ability and this ability in conjunction prove deadly indeed. Using this ability is a free action.
#
Greater Spell Memory (Su): At 22nd level, the akashic can delve into the collective memory once per day to learn how to cast one simple spell of 9th level or lower once (in addition to uses of his spell memory ability). He must have an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the spell's level in order to cast it. The akashic uses his class level as the caster level and Intelligence as the key ability. This ability can be used once per day. At 23rd level, the akashic can use this ability twice per day.

SOURCEPAGE:p.44

Class Ability (Su): At 25th level, the akashic can delve into the collective memory once per day to gain any ability of any other class, gained at 20th level or lower. This ability cannot be used to gain spells, a different base attack bonus, or different saving throws-only level-based class abilities like a magister's mind over matter or the greenbond's infuse with life. No ability gained lingers longer than 24 hours.
