Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Akashic ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:The akashic is proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons and heavy, medium, and light armors and shields.																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Skill Memory					KEY:Akashic ~ Skill Memory							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:Akashics can reach into the collective memory and gain insight into a needed skill-even one in which the character has no ranks and cannot use untrained (but not a language). After a full round of concentration, the akashic gains a +2 bonus to a single skill check attempt made the next round. The akashic can use skill memory once per day per two akashic levels (once per day at 1st through 3rd level, twice per day at 4th and 5th levels, three times per day at 6th and 7th levels, and so on). At 9th level, this bonus becomes +4. At 17th level, it is +6. At 25th level it is +8.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Perfect Recall					KEY:Akashic ~ Perfect Recall							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:By 2nd level, akashics have honed their own memories. To any Knowledge skill check that they make without using skill memory (thus relying on their own memory), they add their Intelligence bonus, if any, to the skill bonus again. Thus, an akashic with 5 ranks of Knowledge (history) and a +2 Intelligence bonus has a skill bonus of +9 (5 + 2 + 2) using perfect recall. Akashics without an Intelligence bonus gain nothing from this ability. The akashic also can add double his Intelligence bonus if the DM calls for an Intelligence check to remember something. Intelligent akashics can use this ability to memorize vast amounts of information, which they can recall at a moment's notice.									SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Delve Into Collective Memory			KEY:Akashic ~ Delve Into Collective Memory				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:An akashic may make a special check with a bonus equal to his level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. This takes 10 minutes and can be attempted once per day per class level. (For some reason, akashics have trouble obtaining information about runechildren. No one knows why.) This check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. The akashic may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random. The DM determines the Difficulty Class of the check by referring to the table below.												SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Minor Akashic Ability				KEY:Akashic ~ Minor Akashic Ability						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th level, the akashic can choose one of the following abilities.

If he selects a ceremonial feat, he need not go through the ceremony (or pay for it); even Unbound characters can gain ceremonial feats this way. However, he must still meet all bonus feat prerequisites, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums and prerequisite feats (but not truenames).																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Creature Loresight				KEY:Minor Akashic Ability ~ Creature Loresight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Sp)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:An akashic can use the spell creature loresight a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence bonus as a spell-like ability. If he does not have an Intelligence bonus, he can use this ability once per week.																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Kinesthetic Memory				KEY:Minor Akashic Ability ~ Kinesthetic Memory				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:An akashic's sensory memory is so precise that he can easily get around with no penalty when he has a single damaged or deprived sense and is in familiar surroundings. For example, a blind akashic can move about in his home, a clothing shop he frequents, or inside a castle he has viewed extensively with magic, operating with no penalties.

Afterward, for 1 round per class level, he gains a +3 competence bonus to attack and damage rolls, as well as a +3 dodge bonus to Armor Class. An akashic can use minor battle memory once per day.																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Object Loresight					KEY:Minor Akashic Ability ~Object Loresight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Sp)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:An akashic can use the object loresight spell a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence bonus as a spell-like ability.

SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Sneak Attack					KEY:Minor Akashic Ability ~Sneak Attack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:Using the akashic memory to remember the vital spots of other creatures, an akashic can make devastating attacks. Any time the akashic's target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the akashic flanks the target, the akashic's attack deals +1d6 extra points of damage. Should the character score a critical hit with a sneak attack, do not multiply this extra damage. The akashic can make sneak attacks with ranged weapons, but only up to a range of 30 feet.																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.41

Lesser Delve Into Personal Memory		KEY:Lesser Akashic Ability ~ Lesser Delve Into Personal Memory	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:An akashic can mentally probe the memory of one other creature within 25 feet. The akashic mentally forms a question the creature can answer with a single word. No shared language is needed, nor does it matter whether the creature is conscious or aware. The creature can make a Will save (DC 10 + half akashic's class level + the akashic's Charisma modifier). If the creature fails its save, the akashic gains the answer as if the creature mentally answered the question as truthfully as possible. In any event, the creature does not know the akashic made the attempt. A character can use this ability once per day as a standard action.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.41

No one can take this shield from her against her will, although it can be dispelled. The shield has a +1 enhancement bonus, with an additional +1 enhancement bonus per five champion levels. It lasts for one minute per champion level and can be called once per day. If the champion already holds a shield in her hand when she uses this ability, she increases the enhancement bonus of the shield by +1 (if no enhancement bonus, the bonus becomes +1) as she imbues it with power. The imbued shield takes on a symbol related to her cause. Unlike a summoned shield, there is no increase of this additional enhancement bonus based on level. Starting at 11th level, the shield (summoned or imbued) negates 50 percent of the criticals the champion might suffer. From 18th level on, this critical negation power extends to all the champion's allies within 10 feet.

No one can take the weapon from her against her will, although it can be dispelled. The weapon has a +1 enhancement bonus, with an additional +1 enhancement bonus per five champion levels. It lasts for one minute per champion level and can be called once per day. If the champion already holds a melee weapon in her hand when using this ability, she increases the weapon's enhancement bonus of by +1 (if it has no enhancement bonus, it becomes +1) as she imbues it with power. Unlike a summoned weapon, there is no level-based increase of this additional enhancement bonus. Starting at 13th level, the weapon (summoned or imbued) has the defending weapon special ability.

The champion can use this ability once per day.																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Focused Devotion			KEY:Champion ~ Focused Devotion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ChampionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:At 10th level, if the champion desires, she can take on a focused devotion-in other words, become the champion of something far more specific than the general concept embodied by her cause. The player should choose either a race, a place, or a person to champion, and this new devotion must not contradict or oppose the principles of her previous cause. A champion can choose to focus her devotion at any time after this level as well. At this point, the champion takes on the abilities gained through her focused devotion rather than from her normal cause. Thus, a champion of life who becomes a champion of giants gains blessing of the race rather than sign of life. Their avatar's allies, true shield, and true weapon abilities are based on their original cause. It is worth noting that in the context of the campaign, a champion rarely chooses her focused devotion-rather, she is usually chosen by someone else. For example, a sibeccai mystic might choose a champion to become a champion of the sibeccai "in their hour of need," or a noble lord might choose an individual to become his personal champion, acting as both a guard in times of danger and a representative when he is not present. Sometimes, though, a champion merely receives a vision or an inspired idea to become a champion with a focused devotion. A champion might choose a noble comrade with what appears to be an important destiny and become her champion-through no choice of the comrade (in fact, she might not even know). See "Focused Devotions" on page 52 for special abilities.	SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Take on the Mantle		KEY:Champion ~ Take on the Mantle			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.ChampionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:Similar to when the champion uses her ability to call upon the power of her cause, but far greater in might, the 12th-level and higher champion can infuse herself with the power of her cause and take on a whole new form. This new form resembles her normal physical form, but everyone around her intuitively knows she has become transformed. The champion speaks with a new voice of great resonance and authority and stands with greater stature and power. The new form adds a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Constitution, and Charisma, and the champion gains DR 10/+1 (or 10/magic) and SR 11 plus her champion level. These powers last for 2 rounds per champion level, and she can use this ability once per day (in addition to her uses of the call upon the power ability). Taking on the mantle is a free action. Most champions give a name to the new form (or their reputation earns them one), such as "The Lion of Righteousness" or "The Hound of Darkness." Others then speak of the new form as a different being: "He has become the Lion of Righteousness."																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.46

It is a full-round action to call the ally, which lasts for 1 round per class level, obeying the champion's mental commands or attacking her enemies (if given no commands). The ally takes on a ghostly, flickering, quasi-amorphous form appropriate to the champion's cause. It uses Large fire elemental statistics, except that it has no vulnerability to cold. It also has special modifications and abilities unique to the champion's cause (see each cause for details). This ability can be used once each day.

SOURCEPAGE:p.55
Spells				KEY:Greenbond ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	TYPE:ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																				DESC:Greenbonds have access to simple spells and all spells with the plant or positive energy descriptors. A greenbond may choose to ready any spell he has access to, provided he can cast spells of that level. He readies spells ahead of time, any of which he can cast up to the maximum number of spell slots available to him for each given level. To ready or cast a spell, a greenbond must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level. The  Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a greenbond's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the greenbond's Wisdom modifier. A greenbond's spells have only verbal and mental components, which imposes no spell failure chance due to armor. Bonus spells for greenbonds are based on Wisdom.

SOURCEPAGE:p.56
Infuse With Life			KEY:Greenbond ~ Infuse With Life			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.56	TYPE:(Sp)ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																				DESC:A greenbond can call upon the positive energy of life and bestow that energy upon himself or another creature. With a touch, he can heal 1d8 hit points + his level a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom bonus; greenbonds with no Wisdom bonus can use this ability once per week. At 4th level, the amount of healing increases to 2d8 points + the greenbond's level and continues to increase every three levels thereafter: 7th level 3d8 + level, 10th level 4d8 + level, 13th level 6d8 +level, 16th level 8d8 + level, 19th level 10d8 + level, 22nd level 12d8 + level, and 25th level 14d8 + level. These changes increase the amount of healing, not the number of times used. For example, if a greenbond has a Wisdom bonus of +3, when he is 1st level, he can infuse someone with life three times per day, each time healing 1d8+1 points. At 4th level, he can still heal only three times per day, but each time now heals 2d8+4 points of damage. At 25th level, the greenbond can apply one of his infuse with life uses to affect a creature as if he had cast perfect health. He cannot do this more than once per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.56
Nature's Gift			KEY:Greenbond ~ Nature's Gift				CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.56	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																				DESC:Once per day, a 2nd-level or higher greenbond can use his connection with the Green to draw on the power of nature and infuse it within himself. He must be touching something solid and natural (the ground, a bit of unworked stone, a plant, an animal, or a beast) to activate this ability. He gains a divine bonus equal to half his level. The greenbond can add this bonus to any d20 roll he makes in the following round. He can impart this gift to an ally he touches during the following round (the ally must use the bonus in that round). He can even divide the bonus among up to five allies that he can reach during the round, giving each a portion of the bonus as he decides. Thus, a 10th-level greenbond could grant a +2 bonus to two allies and a +1 bonus to another. Starting at 12th level, the gift's divine bonus lasts 1 round per four greenbond levels (maximum 5 rounds). Thus, an 18th-level greenbond could grant a 4-round divine bonus of +9 to one ally (or himself), or +3 to three allies, or +5 to one ally and +1 to four others. Each round, those granted the gift can use the bonus on any one d20 roll of their choosing.

Bond With the Green		KEY:Greenbond ~ Bond With the Green			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.56	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																				DESC:At 5th level the greenbond gains the ability that gives his class its name. In a four-hour ritual that he conducts in a private setting, the greenbond gains an intuitive sense of the condition of the land-a literal bond with the Green. This means that if the land is harmed in any way (for instance, a forest fire, a famine, or a disease) within one mile per greenbond level, he becomes aware of it and gains a general understanding of what is happening. If he makes a caster power check (DC 25), he gains more details, such as distance and direction. For example, say a bestial cyclops band is hacking down trees to burn in a huge pyre. A 7th-level greenbond four miles away becomes alerted once they chop down about 25 trees. All the greenbond knows is that numerous trees are dying rapidly. If he makes his caster power check, he knows that it occurs four miles away and the direction. He still does not know specifically that the cyclops band is the culprit. In order for an event to trigger the bond, it must affect an area at least 100 yards across or involving at least 25 creatures or large plants (such as trees). Natural, daily events, such as predators hunting, do not alert the greenbond. At 15th level, the greenbond undergoes a three-day solitary trek into the wilderness, eating and drinking nothing other than special herbs and water. This experience increases his bond with the Green so that plants surrounding him infuse into his body. From that point on, he is no longer considered a humanoid (or whatever type he is), but a plant. Anything that specifically does not harm plants will not harm the greenbond. However, he remains a living, thinking creature, so mind-affecting spells work on him, and he still has a discernable anatomy, so sneak attacks and critical hits affect him. At 20th level, the greenbond undertakes a spiritwalk, communing with nature spirits for nine days, during which he is simply absent from the world. After this period of communion, he no longer need make Diplomacy checks when speaking with nature spirits-they will always speak with him willingly (see below). At 21st level, spirits actively seek out the greenbond to tell him news that is of interest or importance to him. At 23rd level, the greenbond can take the shape of a tree as a standard action, if standing on solid ground where a tree could potentially grow. There is no way to determine that the tree is actually a greenbond-even magic does not reveal him to be anything but the tree he appears to be. While a tree, the greenbond cannot move or take actions other than to cast spells or use abilities that affect only him. For example, he could cast plant armor on himself while he was a tree or use infuse with life upon himself. None of this requires movement of any kind on the part of the tree-greenbond. What's more, the greenbond must root himself in natural earth and take on the form of a tree for eight hours each day rather than sleeping. During this time, he remains completely aware of his surroundings and can change back. The eight hours need not be consecutive. Due to this transformation, the greenbond needs only sunlight, water, and the touch of the earth to sustain him. He no longer requires sleep, air, or food. At 24th level, the fusion with plants that occurred at 15th level becomes so complete that the greenbond's anatomy changes to resemble a plant. His skin takes on a greenish sheen. He no longer has a discernable anatomy and thus becomes immune to sneak attacks and critical hits.																SOURCEPAGE:p.56
Percipience				KEY:Greenbond ~ Percipience				CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.57	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																				DESC:Starting at 6th level, greenbonds can see and hear nature spirits otherwise imperceptible to mortals (unless a spirit wishes to show itself). The character finds this ability disconcerting at first, because it makes him realize how pervasive spirits are: They are everywhere, all the time- although only rarely do they pay attention to the actions of mortals. Greenbonds sometimes become alerted to danger when the nature spirits of an area are upset or absent.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.57
Speak With Spirits		KEY:Greenbond ~ Speak With Spirits			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.57	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																				DESC:The 8th-level and higher greenbond can speak with the spirit of a tree, a brook, the air, or any other part of nature that he touches. Once per day he can ask a spirit a question with a one-word answer. Generally, only natural things have spirits-wood made into a door or water in a fountain usually has lost its spirit. The spirit is not omniscient. It knows all observable facts about its surroundings, and can answer any such question with 100 percent accuracy. For example, if a greenbond asked the spirit of a river if any people on horseback had crossed it in the last three days, it would be able to answer the question. A spirit's surroundings are never more than a 100- yard radius, however-a river miles long has many spirits. A spirit has a 75 percent chance, plus 1 percent per level of the greenbond, to know the answer to a question about things farther afield, such as, "Is the dragon still over the next hill?" It never knows the answer to a question pertaining to the future or to the thoughts of another: "Can I defeat the dragon in battle?" or "Does the dragon know I'm here?" To convince the spirit to give an answer, the greenbond must make a Diplomacy check. A failed check might result in no answer, or it might result in a lie (DM's discretion). The check's Difficulty Class depends on the type of spirit: Spirit DC																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.57	DESC: Water spirit 10; Wood spirit 15; Air spirit 18; Animal spirit 20; Stone spirit 30.	DESC: At 14th level, a greenbond can ask a question that requires an answer of up to one word per greenbond level or a series of yes/no questions-one per greenbond level.
Spiritform				KEY:Greenbond ~ Spiritform				CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.57	TYPE:(Sp)ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																				DESC:At 17th level, the greenbond can make his body into a spiritform for up to one minute per level. Spiritform allows the greenbond to become incorporeal for the ability's duration. This ability is usable once per day.

###Block: Mage Blade Class Abilities

# Ability Name			Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type											Visible	Define							Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								Automatically Gained Feat			Bonus to Ability Pool					Modify VAR			Source Page		Ignore Encumberance
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Mage Blade ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality												DESC:Mage blades are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and light armor and shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.59
Spells				KEY:Mage Blade ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality												DESC:Mage blades have access to simple spells. A mage blade may choose to ready any simple spell provided she can cast spells of that level. She readies spells ahead of time, any of which she can cast up to the maximum number of spell slots available to her for each given level. To ready or cast a spell, a mage blade must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a mage blade's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the mage blade's Charisma modifier. Bonus spells for mage blades rely on Charisma. Mage blades never gain access to 9th- or 10th-level spells. Mage blade spells always have both somatic and verbal components. Thus, these characters face spell failure chances when wearing armor. An exception to this requirement applies if the mage blade holds her key weapon in her hand(s). In such a case, her spells have only verbal components, so she suffers no spell failure chances when wearing armor. (Technically, the mage blade usually motions with the sword when casting spells, but this is not considered actual somatic components for purposes of spell failure in armor, casting spells while grappled, and so on.)																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.59
Athame				KEY:Mage Blade ~ Athame					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality												DESC:The mage blade selects a bladed weapon that she is proficient with and performs a daylong ceremony to make it her key weapon, also called an "athame." A mage blade can have only one athame, and the athame must be a physical weapon (not the creation of a spell), although it can be enhanced with magic. The athame gains a +1 enhancement bonus, which functions only in the mage blade's hands. At 4th level, and every four mage blade levels afterward, this bonus increases by +1 (maximum +5), The weapon does not have to be masterwork to use it as an athame, but if the mage blade ever wants to enhance it with weapon special abilities, such as keen or dancing, it must be masterwork. This ability provides enough of an enhancement bonus to give the blade special abilities without first giving it at least a +1 enhancement bonus using the normal item creation rules. The athame gains a small modicum of sentience in the ceremony. It has a very basic empathic link with the mage blade, so the character always knows where the weapon is (distance and direction). The athame serves as a special focus for all the mage blade's spells. As long as it remains in her hands, her spells have no somatic components. A mage blade can create a new athame by performing the ceremony again, but this results in the destruction of the previous athame, if it still exists. Starting at 6th level, the athame strikes at anyone other than the mage blade who picks it up or attempts to use it, unless the mage blade specifically commands it not to. The weapon strikes once per round until dropped, using the mage blade's attack bonuses. Resolve the attack as if the mage blade were wielding the weapon. Beginning at 9th level, the mage blade can summon her athame to appear immediately in her hand as a standard action. The weapon can be up to 10 miles per class level away, although if it is in someone else's possession or in a locked room, the mage blade must make a caster power check (DC 25) to summon it. Starting at 14th level, this summons becomes a free action, usable once per round. A mage blade with a double weapon as her athame only enjoys the benefits granted by this ability on one end of the weapon.																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Shimmering Shield			KEY:Mage Blade ~ Shimmering Shield			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Sp)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality												DESC:The 4th-level and higher mage blade can call a magical shield to surround her like a shimmering aura. This shield provides a +2 deflection bonus to Armor Class per four class levels and does not require the mage blade to wield it as a shield (she keeps both hands free). The shimmering shield can be called upon, as a standard action, once per day for 1 round per level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Bonus Feats				KEY:Mage Blade ~ Bonus Feats				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality												DESC:At 5th level, the mage blade gets a bonus feat. The mage blade gains an additional bonus feat at 10th level, and another at 15th, 20th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th level. These are in addition to the feats a character gets every third level. Draw these bonus feats from the following list: Armor Proficiency (Heavy), Armor Proficiency (Medium), Bloody Strike, Bonded Item, Combat Reflexes, Complex Spell*, Defensive Move (Mobility), Defensive Stance, Defensive Unarmed Strike, Expertise (Improved Disarm, Improved Trip), Exotic Armor Proficiency, Exotic Weapon Proficiency*, Exotic Spell*, Hunter Mage, Improved Critical*, Improved Initiative, Modify Spell, Point Blank Shot (Far Shot, Precise Shot, Shot on the Run), Psion, Quick Draw, Rapid Strike, Stunning Blow, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus*. Some of these feats are ceremonial feats. The character need not go through the ceremony (or pay for it) to get a bonus ceremonial feat; even an Unbound character can choose a ceremonial bonus feat in this way. A mage blade cannot acquire some of these bonus feats until she has gained one or more prerequisite feats; these feats appear parenthetically after the prerequisite feat. A mage blade can select feats marked with an asterisk (*) more than once, but it must be for a different weapon, spell, or spell level (depending on the feat) each time. The character must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums (but not truenames).																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Sprightly Step			KEY:Mage Blade ~ Sprightly Step			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality												DESC:The 7th-level and higher mage blade gains proficiency with medium armor but retains her normal movement rate while wearing it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.60	UNENCUMBEREDMOVE:MediumArmor
Slice Through Wardings		KEY:Mage Blade ~ Slice Through Wardings		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality												DESC:Once per day per class level, starting at 11th level, the mage blade can ignore all magic-based protections (Armor Class bonuses, defensive field, and so on) on a foe in a single attack made with her athame. The mage blade cannot use this ability to ignore spells or effects that take effect when a foe is attacked, such as feedback strike. The character must declare her use of this ability before making the attack.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Familiarity With Magic		KEY:Mage Blade ~ Familiarity With Magic		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality												DESC:The 12th-level and higher mage blade gains a +2 competence bonus to all saving throws against spells and spell-like and supernatural abilities (including magic items). Further, she gains a +2 competence bonus to Armor Class against spells requiring attack rolls.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Spell Parry				KEY:Mage Blade ~ Spell Parry				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality												DESC:A 16th-level and higher mage blade gains the ability to parry spells. The mage blade must have her athame in hand to parry a spell. Only spells targeting the mage blade alone can be parried-not area spells or spells targeted elsewhere. The mage blade makes an attack roll opposed by the caster's caster power check. If the mage blade's roll is higher, the spell fails to affect her at all. The mage blade can parry only spells she is aware of; spells from invisible casters or those casting mental-action only spells cannot be parried. No more than one spell can be parried in a round.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Slice Through Spells		KEY:Mage Blade ~ Slice Through Spells		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality												DESC:Once per day, beginning at 18th level, the mage blade can strike a non-instantaneous spell effect or creation (a summoned monster, an eldritch wall, an illusion, an area of obscuring mist, and so on) with her athame and dispel it as if she had cast dispel magic using her class level as the caster level. A mage blade cannot dispel effects on a creature (like dominate or sorcerous guise), only "stand-alone" effects. Even spells not normally subject to dispel magic can be affected.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Athame Critical			KEY:Mage Blade ~ Athame Critical			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality												DESC:At 22nd level and above, when the mage blade makes an attack roll that falls into the natural threat range of the athame (not modified by magic or feats such as Improved Critical), the critical hit is automatically confirmed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Athame Burst			KEY:Mage Blade ~ Athame Burst				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality												DESC:The 25th-level mage blade can, using a full attack action, spin around with her athame and send replicas of the blade, composed of magical energy, toward all foes within 30 feet. The mage blade makes a separate melee attack roll against each foe, using her highest attack bonus. Each successful attack inflicts damage as if the mage blade struck the foe with the athame. The mage blade can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus. If she has no Charisma bonus, she can use this ability once per week.
