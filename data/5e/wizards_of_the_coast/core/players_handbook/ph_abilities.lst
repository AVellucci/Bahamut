Blindsight	CATEGORY:Special Ability	VISION:Blindsight (BlindsightRange')		DESC:A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.

Truesight	CATEGORY:Special Ability	VISION:Truesight (TruesightRange')			DESC:A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

DESC:Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king. The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard w ould rather be honest than politic. The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at selfimportant figures of authority.

Wild Shape				KEY:Druid ~ Wild Shape					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed. You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them. When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious. You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is w orn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't w ear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

#Druid Circles	Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally m embers of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other. At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.

C o m b a t Su p e r io r i t y
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. Maneuvers. You learn three maneuvers o f your choice, which are detailed under “Maneuvers” below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers o f your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one. Superiority Dice. You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all o f your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level. Saving Throws. Some o f your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
St u d e n t o f W a r
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan’s tools o f your choice.
K n o w Y o u r E n e m y
Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice: • Strength score • Dexterity score • Constitution score • Armor Class • Current hit points • Total class levels (if any) • Fighter class levels (if any)
Im p r o v e d C o m b a t Su p e r io r i t y

# Maneuvers	The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.
Commander’s Strike. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one o f your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one o f your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one w eapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.
Disarming Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item o f your choice that it’s holding. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.
Distracting Strike. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start o f your next turn.
Evasive Footwork. When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.
Feinting Attack. You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet o f you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.
Goading Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a W isdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.
Lunging Attack. When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.
Maneuvering Attack. When you hit a creature with a w eapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one o f your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target o f your attack.
Menacing Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a W isdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened o f you until the end o f your next turn.
Parry. When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.
Precision Attack. When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects o f the attack are applied.
Pushing Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.
Rally. On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve o f one o f your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature w ho can see or hear you.

Trip Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.

E l d r i t c h K n i g h t
The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools o f magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter’s reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number o f spells, committing them to memory instead o f keeping them in a spellbook.
Sp e l l c a s t in g
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules o f spellcasting and chapter 11 for the w izard spell list.
Cantrips. You learn two cantrips o f your choice from the w izard spell list. You learn an additional w izard cantrip o f your choice at 10th level.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher. You know three 1st-level w izard spells of your choice, two o f which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column o f the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more w izard spells o f 1st level or higher. Each o f these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell o f your choice, and must be o f a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell o f 1st or 2nd level. The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school o f magic. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one o f the w izard spells you know with another spell o f your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be o f a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.

W e a p o n B o n d
At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course o f 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The w eapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion o f which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed o f that w eapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand. You can have up to two bonded w eapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third w eapon, you must break the bond with one o f the other two.
W a r M a g ic
Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one w eapon attack as a bonus action.
E l d r i t c h St r ik e
At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature’s resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.
A r c a n e C h a r g e
At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action.

###Block: Monk
U n a r m o r e d D e f e n s e
Beginning at 1st level, while you are w earing no armor and not w ielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity m odifier + your Wisdom modifier.
M a r t i a l A r t s
At 1st level, your practice o f martial arts gives you mastery o f combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk w eapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only m onk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or w ielding a shield: • You can use Dexterity instead o f Strength for the attack and damage rolls o f your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. • You can roll a d4 in place o f the normal damage o f your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. • When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. Certain monasteries use specialized forms o f the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths o f w o od connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in chapter 5.
Ki
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy o f ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number o f points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column o f the Monk table. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry o f Blows, Patient Defense, and Step o f the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end o f which you draw all o f your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes o f the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some o f your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
F l u r r y o f B l o w s
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.
Pa t i e n t D e f e n s e
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.
St e p o f t h e W in d

M o n a s t i c T r a d i t i o n
When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way o f the Open Hand, the Way o f Shadow, or the Way o f the Four Elements, all detailed at the end o f the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
D e f l e c t M i s s i l e s
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece o f ammunition you just caught, as part o f the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless o f your w eapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score o f your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores o f your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

S t u n n i n g S t r i k e
Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee w eapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
K i - E m p o w e r e d S t r i k e s
Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose o f overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
E v a s i o n
At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out o f the way o f certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
S t i l l n e s s o f M i n d
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.
P u r i t y o f B o d y
At 10th level, your mastery o f the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.
T o n g u e o f t h e S u n a n d M o o n
Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki o f other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.
D i a m o n d S o u l
Beginning at 14th level, your mastery o f ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws. Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.

T im e l e s s B o d y
At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none o f the frailty o f old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die o f old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.
E m p t y B o d y
Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage. Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.
P e r f e c t S e l f
At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.

# M onastic T raditions

W a y o f t h e O p e n H a n d
Monks o f the Way o f the Open Hand are the ultimate masters o f martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.

O p e n H a n d T e c h n iq u e
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one o f the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one o f the following effects on that target: • It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. • It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you. • It can’t take reactions until the end o f your next turn.
W h o l e n e s s o f B o d y
At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
T r a n q u i l i t y
Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura o f peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect o f a sanctuary spell that lasts until the start o f your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your W isdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.
Q u i v e r in g Pa l m
At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number o f days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane o f existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d 10 necrotic damage. You can have only one creature under the effect o f this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.

W a y o f S h a d o w
Monks of the Way o f Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members o f a ninja monastery are family m embers, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves’ guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads o f these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience o f their students.

S h a d o w A r t s
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can use your ki to duplicate the effects o f certain spells. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast darkness, darkvision, pass without trace, or silence, without providing material components. Additionally, you gain the minor illusion cantrip if you don’t already know it.
Sh a d o w St e p
At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end o f the turn.
C l o a k o f Sh a d o w s
By 11th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area o f dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area o f bright light.
O p p o r t u n i s t
At 17th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet o f you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.

W a y o f t h e F o u r E l e m e n t s
You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces o f creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension o f your body. Some members o f this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together. Many monks o f this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations o f their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.

D i s c ip l e o f t h e E l e m e n t s
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power o f the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it. You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental discipline o f your choice, which are detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines” section below. You learn one additional elemental discipline o f your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline. Casting Elemental Spells. Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules o f spellcasting. To cast one o f these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don’t need to provide material components for it. Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level o f an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline’s base cost o f 2 ki points plus 1). The maximum number o f ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.


E l e m e n t a l D is c i p l in e s
The elemental disciplines are presented in alphabetical order. If a discipline requires a level, you must be that level in this class to learn the discipline.
Breath o f Winter (17th Level Required). You can spend 6 ki points to cast cone o f cold.
Clench o f the North Wind (6th Level Required). You can spend 3 ki points to cast hold person.
Elemental Attunement. You can use your action to briefly control elemental forces nearby, causing one of the following effects o f your choice:• Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of sparks, a puff o f wind, a spray o f light mist, or a gentle rumbling o f stone.• Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.• Chill or warm up to 1 pound o f nonliving material for up to 1 hour.• Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1-foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you designate for 1 minute.
Eternal Mountain Defense (11th Level Required). You can spend 5 ki points to cast stoneskin, targeting yourself.
Fangs o f the Fire Snake. When you use the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to cause tendrils o f flame to stretch out from your fists and feet. Your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 10 feet for that action, as well as the rest o f the turn. A hit with such an attack deals fire damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and if you spend 1 ki point when the attack hits, it also deals an extra 1d 10 fire damage.
Fist o f Four Thunders. You can spend 2 ki points to cast thunderwave.
Fist o f Unbroken Air. You can create a blast of compressed air that strikes like a mighty fist. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and choose a creature within 30 feet o f you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3 d 10 bludgeoning damage, plus an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can push the creature up to 20 feet away from you and knock it prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don’t push it or knock it prone.
Flames o f the Phoenix (11th Level Required). You can spend 4 ki points to cast fireball.
Gong o f the Summit (6th Level Required). You can spend 3 ki points to cast shatter.
Mist Stance (11th Level Required). You can spend 4 ki points to cast gaseous form, targeting yourself.

Shape the Flowing River. As an action, you can spend 1 ki point to choose an area o f ice or water no larger than 30 feet on a side within 120 feet o f you. You can change water to ice within the area and v ice versa, and you can reshape ice in the area in any manner you choose. You can raise or lower the ice’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent o f any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. For example, if you affect a 30-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 15 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 15 feet, dig a trench up to 15 feet deep, and so on. You can’t shape the ice to trap or injure a creature in the area.
Sweeping Cinder Strike. You can spend 2 ki points to cast burning hands.
Water Whip. You can spend 2 ki points as a bonus action to create a whip o f water that shoves and pulls a creature to unbalance it. A creature that you can see that is within 30 feet o f you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3 d 10 bludgeoning damage, plus an extra 1d 10 bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can either knock it prone or pull it up to 25 feet closer to you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don’t pull it or knock it prone.
Wave o f Rolling Earth (17th Level Required). You can spend 6 ki points to cast wall of stone.

###Block: Paladin
D i v i n e S e n s e
The presence o f strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end o f your next turn, you know the location o f any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet o f you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) o f any being w hose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence o f any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.
L a y o n H a n d s
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool o f healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5. As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number o f hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool o f healing to cure the target o f one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use o f Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
F i g h t i n g S t y l e	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Paladin Fighting Style|1
At 2nd level, you adopt a style o f fighting as your specialty. Choose one o f the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
S p e l l c a s t i n g
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules o f spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.
Sp e l l c a s t in g Fo c u s
You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.

D i v i n e S m i t e
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee w eapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the w eapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum o f 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.
D i v i n e H e a l t h
By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.
S a c r e d O a t h
When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath o f Devotion, the Oath o f the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end o f the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.
O a t h Sp e l l s
Each oath has a list o f associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number o f spells you can prepare each day. If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.
C h a n n e l D i v in i t y
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score o f your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
E x t r a A t t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead o f once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
A u r a o f P r o t e c t i o n
Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet o f you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus o f +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
A u r a o f C o u r a g e
Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet o f you can’t be frightened while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
I m p r o v e d D i v i n e S m i t e
By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee w eapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee w eapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage o f your Divine Smite.
C l e a n s i n g T o u c h
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number o f times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum o f once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Sacred Oaths
O a t h o f D e v o t i o n
The Oath o f Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals o f justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal o f the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit o f justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or w orse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods o f law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure o f their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants o f good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats o f arms.

3rd protection from evil and good, sanctuary
5th lesser restoration, zone o f truth
9th beacon o f hope, dispel magic
13th freedom o f movement, guardian o f faith
17th commune, flame strike

C h a n n e l D i v i n i t y
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus o f +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn as part o f any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this w eapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
Turn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet o f you must make a W isdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet o f you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
A u r a o f D e v o t io n
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet o f you can’t be charmed while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
P u r i t y o f S p ir it
Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects o f a protection from evil and good spell.
H o l y N im b u s
At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

O a t h o f t h e A n c i e n t s
The Oath o f the Ancients is as old as the race o f elves and the rituals o f the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side o f the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things o f the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images o f growing things—leaves, antlers, or flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.

3rd ensnaring strike, speak with animals
5th moonbeam, misty step
9th plant growth, protection from energy
13th ice storm, stoneskin
17th commune with nature, tree stride

C h a n n e l D i v in i t y
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
Nature’s Wrath. You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet o f you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end o f each o f its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the v ines vanish.
Turn the Faithless. You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient w ords that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet o f you that can hear you must make a W isdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet o f you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.

A u r a o f W a r d in g
Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet o f you have resistance to damage from spells. At 18th level, the range o f this aura increases to 30 feet.
U n d y in g S e n t in e l
Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Additionally, you suffer none o f the drawbacks o f old age, and you can’t be aged magically.
E l d e r C h a m p io n
At 20th level, you can assume the form o f an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or mosslike, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits: • At the start o f each o f your turns, you regain 10 hit points. • Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time o f 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead. • Enemy creatures within 10 feet o f you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

O a t h o f V e n g e a n c e
The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the w ill of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside—at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath o f Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins— sometimes called avengers or dark knights—their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.

3rd bane, hunter’s mark
5th hold person, misty step
9th haste, protection from energy
13th banishment, dimension door
17th hold monster, scrying

C h a n n e l D i v in i t y
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
Abjure Enemy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer o f denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet o f you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed. On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.
Vow o f Enmity. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow o f enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet o f you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.
R e l e n t l e s s A v e n g e r
By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.
S o u l o f V e n g e a n c e
Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow o f Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect o f your Vow o f Enmity m akes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.
A v e n g in g A n g e l
At 20th level, you can assume the form o f an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits: • Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed o f 60 feet. • You emanate an aura o f menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.


###Block: Ranger
Fa v o r e d E n e m y
Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type o f enemy. Choose a type o f favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races o f humanoid (such as gnolls and orc s) as favored enemies. You have advantage on W isdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as w ell as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. When you gain this feature, you also learn one language o f your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all. You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.
N a t u r a l E x p l o r e r
You are particularly familiar with one type o f natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type o f favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in. While traveling for an hour or m ore in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits: • Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel. • Your group can’t become lost except by magical means. • Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. • If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. • When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. • While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.
F i g h t i n g S t y l e
	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Ranger Fighting Style|1
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style o f fighting as your specialty. Choose one o f the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.


S p e l l c a s t i n g
By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence o f nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.
S p e l l S l o t s
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells o f 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot o f the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.
Sp e l l s K n o w n o f 1s t L e v e l a n d H ig h e r
You know two 1st-level spells o f your choice from the ranger spell list. The Spells Known column o f the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells o f your choice. Each o f these spells must be o f a level for which you have

R a n g e r A r c h e t y p e
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end o f the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.
P r i m e v a l A w a r e n e s s
Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level o f the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.
A b i l i t y S c o r e I m p r o v e m e n t
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score o f your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
E x t r a A t t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Extra Attack ~ 1
L a n d ’s S t r i d e
Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.
H i d e i n P l a i n S i g h t
Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally o ccurring materials with which to create your camouflage. Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by p ressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and w ide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.
V a n i s h
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
F e r a l S e n s e s
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware o f the location o f any invisible creature within 30 feet o f you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.
F o e S l a y e r
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter o f your enemies. Once on each o f your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one o f your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

# Ranger Archetypes
H u n t e r
Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness.

The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts o f the world. United in focus, beast and ranger w ork as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wilderness alike.

#Arcane Traditions	 The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of D&D, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study. The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools, as described in chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. Elsewhere, they are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.

When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
Potent Cantrip		KEY:School of Evocation ~ Potent Cantrip					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:School of Evocation Tradition.SpecialQuality	DESC: Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect.

When you cast a wizard spell of 5th level or lower that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.
