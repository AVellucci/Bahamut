Blindsight	CATEGORY:Special Ability			DESC:A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.
Darkvision	CATEGORY:Special Ability			DESC:Many creatures in the worlds of D&D, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Truesight	CATEGORY:Special Ability			DESC:A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

# Damage Types
# Acid			. The corrosive spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.
# Bludgeoning		. Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.
# Cold			. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage.
# Fire		. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

# Lightning	. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon's breath deal lightning damage.
# Necrotic	. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and some spells, withers matter and even the soul.
# Piercing	. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.
# Poison	. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage.
# Psychic	. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer's psionic blast deal psychic damage.
# Radiant	. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's flame strike spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.
# Slashing	. Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.
# Thunder	. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.

DESC:Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.
