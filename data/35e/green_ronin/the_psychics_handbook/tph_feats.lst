If your psychic link is broken, it is automatically reestablished as soon as possible.

The target gets an additional Will save each day to regain the use of his psychic abilities and another use of Psychic Surgery (DC 30) can reverse the effect. With the expenditure of 3,000 XP, the psychic severance becomes permanent and can only be reversed by a psychic with this feat who makes a DC 30 Psychic Surgery check and spends an additional 3,000 XP. Time: Psychic Severance is a full-round action. You must be in mental contact with the subject. You can take 10 on the Psychic Surgery check, but you can't take 20. Strain: 15.
