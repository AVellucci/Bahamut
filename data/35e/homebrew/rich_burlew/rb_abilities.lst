# Fix to Polymorph
#The Druid - Replace the druid's existing wild shape, elemental wild shape, and thousand faces abilities with the following:
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Druid ~ Wild Shape.MOD		DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:At 5th level, the druid gains the ability to change its shape into that of an animal once per day. The druid may apply the Polymorphed template to himself, as long as the assumed shape is that of an Animal of Small or Medium size. The effect lasts for 1 hour/druid level, or until he chooses to change back. Changing form is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Use the druid's class level for all effects related to caster level, rather than total Hit Dice; any other class that grants wild shape abilities stack with druid levels to determine caster level. This ability otherwise functions exactly like the Animorph spell. The druid gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, a Huge animal at 15th level, and a Diminutive animal at 17th level. At 12th level, the druid can take the form of a Plant (such as a shambling mound) or a Vermin, with the same size restrictions as for Animals. At 19th level, the druid may take the form of an Animal or Vermin with the Swarm subtype. The druid gains additional uses of the wild shape ability at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Druid ~ Elemental Shape.MOD	DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:At 16th level, the druid gains the ability to take the form of an elemental. Similar to wild shape, they may apply the Polymorphed template to himself, as long as the assumed shape is that of a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water). They may use this ability once per day, and the effects last 10 min./level or until he chooses to change back. This ability otherwise functions exactly like the wild shape ability. The druid gains additional uses of the elemental shape ability at 18th and 20th, and may take the form of Huge elementals at 20th level as well. 
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Druid ~ A Thousand Faces.MOD	DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:At 13th level, the druid may change his appearance at will as a standard action, as if casting the alter spell on himself. Unlike the spell, however, the druid may only use this ability while he does not possess the Polymorphed template.


###Block: Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Features
Weapon and Armor Proficiencies	KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiencies		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The bearer of the Ancestral Weapon gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.
Spellcasting				KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Spellcasting					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level and at every even-numbered level, the bearer of the Ancestral Weapon increases in spellcasting ability as if she had gained a level in a spellcasting class to which she had already belonged. She gains no other benefits of an increased level in that class, such as bonus metamagic feats. If she belonged to more than one spellcasting class, she must choose one at 1st level to which she must apply all spellcasting increases granted by this class.
Ancestral Weapon				KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Ancestral Weapon					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 1st level, the bearer learns to use her heirloom weapon as a channel for the spirit of her dead ancestor, granting the object increasing magical power as the bearer advances and achieves deeper levels of meditation. The maximum power of the enchantment is equal to her class level, so that at 1st level, she can grant her weapon a +1 enhancement bonus, while at 10th level, she could enchant it with powers up to the cost equivalent of +10 (such as a +5 holy keen flaming burst longsword). The bearer must still fulfill any prerequisites for enchanting the weapon with a specific power, such as alignment or the casting of a specific spell, but she need spend no gold or XP to complete the crafting. The process takes the same amount of time as normal, however. The bearer of the Ancestral Weapon may repeatedly enchant her weapon as she advances in level, improving the weapon as one would add enhancements to an already magical weapon. Once the bearer has spent the required time meditating on the weapon, it is permanently magical, even if it leaves the bearer's hands. If the weapon used to fulfill the "Special" prerequisite for this class is already magical, the bearer may not further enhance the weapon's power until her class level exceeds its current total "plusses". The bearer may only have one Ancestral Weapon at a time; if it is destroyed, she must locate another heirloom that belonged to one or more of her ancestors and begin the process anew. If the new weapon belonged to a different ancestor, the DM is free to have a different spirit possess it, thus altering the lesser and greater powers gained via the spirit (below) to fit the new spirit.
Unity of Purpose				KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Unity of Purpose					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The magic of the Ancestral Weapon is such that the weapon wants to remain whole and in its descendant's hand. Add the bearer's class level to opposed attack rolls to resist attempts to disarm the weapon from her. The weapon cannot be sundered while it is wielded by the bearer, though it can be damaged or even destroyed while unattended or in the hands of another.
Greater Unity				KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Greater Unity					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By 7th level, whenever the weapon is separated from the bearer, she can sense its direction by concentrating for a full round. She cannot sense the weapon if it lies on another plane.
Spirit of the Ancestor			KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Spirit of the Ancestor				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As the bearer learns to channel her ancestor, the previous owner's spirit comes to reside in the weapon itself. Starting at 2nd level, the Ancestral Wow becomes an intelligent magical item; the bearer does not need to spend any time, money, or XP for this metamorphosis to occur. The ancestor has difficulty manifesting its will at first, but as the bearer continues her meditations and follows the path of the weapon, the spirit gains in power. Eventually, the weapon takes on the full personality and memories of the ancestor. The bearer presumably attempts to contact an ancestor of similar tendencies as her own; the spirit's alignment is thus always within one step of that of the bearer herself. However, the ancestor may have its own ideas on how to solve problems, and might even attempt to take control of the bearer if their views differ sharply on an issue. The weapon's Ego score is equal to that of a weapon with the sum of its accumulated powers. The DM should fully detail the ancestor's history and personality as he or she would any NPC, and play them appropriately.

#The spirit of the ancestor gains the following powers:
Empathy			KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Empathy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, the weapon can communicate via empathy, pulsing or throbbing to indicate approval or dissent while the bearer wields it.
Speech			KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Speech			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By 4th level, the spirit learns to speak aloud, learning one language per point of Intelligence bonus (and gaining an additional language whenever the spirit's Intelligence raises).
Telepathy			KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Telepathy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 8th level, the Ancestral Weapon has mastered telepathy, and can communicate with its bearer silently while within 30 feet. Either the bearer or the sword can initiate telepathic communication as a free action on their turn.
Score Increase		KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Score Increase		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The spirit of the weapon begins at 2nd level with two mental ability scores of 12 and one of 10; the DM allocates these between Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as he sees fit. Whenever the bearer reaches a level where a score increase is indicated, the DM increases any two of these ability scores by +1, permanently.
Senses			KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Senses			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As the spirit becomes more adept at channeling itself through the heirloom, its ability to perceive the world increases. Its vision and hearing ranges increase, and it gains first darkvision, then blindsense, both of which continue to improve as well.
Skill Points		KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Skill Points		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The weapon gains skill points equal its Intelligence bonus whenever the bearer raises her class level. The DM may spend these skill points on the following skills: Intimidate, Decipher Script, Knowledge (any), Search, Spot, Listen, Spellcraft, Sense Motive, Bluff, and Diplomacy. The weapon has maximum ranks equal to three more than the bearer's class level.
Lesser Power		KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Lesser Power		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Whenever the spirit gains a lesser power, the DM chooses any one 1st or 2nd level spell; the Ancestral Weapon may now activate that spell as a spell-like ability, three times per day. The power should reflect the personality and nature of the ancestor inhabiting the weapon; the tables for random determination of an intelligent item's lesser powers may be used instead. The spirit uses its highest ability score to determine the saving throw DC, if necessary, and the caster level is equal to the bearer's class level.
Greater Power		KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Greater Power		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Whenever the spirit gains a greater power, the DM chooses any one 3rd or 4th level spell; the Ancestral Weapon may now activate that spell as a spell-like ability, three times per day. Alternately, the DM may choose a 1st or 2nd level spell that can be used as a spell-like ability at will. The power should reflect the personality and nature of the ancestor inhabiting the weapon; the tables for random determination of an intelligent item's greater powers may be used instead. The spirit uses its highest ability score to determine the saving throw DC, if necessary, and the caster level is equal to the bearer's class level.
Weapon Crafter		KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Weapon Crafter		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, the bearer's experience enchanting her Ancestral Weapon grants her a greater understanding of all magical weapons. She may enchant all weapons of the same type as her Ancestral Weapon for 50%% of the normal cost in gold and XP, and all other weapons for 75%% of the normal cost. If her Ancestral Weapon is a projectile weapon, she may also enchant matching ammunition for 50%% cost. The time required for any such enchantments is not reduced from its original level. In addition, she may also craft magical weapons as if her caster level was equal to her total character level; she must still fulfill any spell prerequisites as normal.
