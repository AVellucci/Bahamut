Incandent Racial Traits
bullet	
+2 Con, -2 Wis, +2 Cha: Incandents are naturally robust, but often jump to conclusions and can be prone to suggestion. However, they have a natural ebullience that often wins over allies.
bullet	
Medium: As Medium creatures, incandents have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.
bullet	
+2 racial bonus on Spot checks: Incandents have keen eyes.
bullet	
+2 racial bonus on saves against death effects and negative energy effects. Infused with the positive energy of their heritage, incandents are naturally resistant to effects that would snuff out that life-force.
bullet	
Positive Aura: All living creatures within 10 feet of an incandent gain a +1 morale bonus to saves. This is a mind-affecting effect and does not include the incandent herself.
bullet	
Enhanced Magic: Three times per day, an incandent can empower a Conjuration (Healing) spell as she casts the spell, as if she had applied the Empower Spell feat. This empowering has no effect on the spell's level or casting time.
bullet	
Darkness Fatigue: If an incandent spends at least one full round in an area of total natural darkness (not just shadows), or is within the area of a spell with the Darkness descriptor, he becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity, can't run or charge). This condition lasts until the character leaves the area of darkness, at which point the character immediately returns to normal.
bullet	
Automatic Languages: Common, Celestial. Bonus Languages: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, Terran.
bullet	
Outsider Traits: The incandent is an Outsider (Native).
bullet	
Favored Class: Fighter. A multiclass incandent's fighter class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty. Physical activity comes naturally to an incandent, and most revel in combat.
bullet	
Level Adjustment: +0. Though robust and hearty, the incandent's vulnerability to darkness is a distinct weakness.


Voidling Racial Traits
bullet	
-2 Con, +2 Dex, -2 Cha: Voidlings are naturally sneaky, but tend to be unhealthy and have bland personalities that draw little attention to themselves.
bullet	
Medium: As Medium creatures, voidlings have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.
bullet	
+2 racial bonus on Hide checks. A voidling blends naturally with shadows and darkness, making it excellent at concealing itself.
bullet	
Darkvision: Voidlings can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but is otherwise like normal sight, and voidlings can function just fine with no light at all.
bullet	
Negative Aura: Any living creature within 10 feet of a voidling loses 1 hp per round due to the aura of negative energy surrounding the creature. Other voidlings, and all characters immune to negative energy effects, are immune to this aura. The voidling can turn this aura off as a standard action, but suffers 1 point of Strength damage for each full minute that the aura is inactive.
 bullet	
Enhanced Magic: Three times per day, a voidling can increase the effective level of  a spell with the Death descriptor as he casts the spell, as if he had applied the Heighten Spell feat. This heightening raises the spell's effective level by two (even if that would be higher than his normal maximum spell level), but has no effect on the spell's actual level or casting time.
bullet	
Light Sensitivity: Voidlings are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell (-1 penalty on attack rolls, Spot checks, and Search checks).
 bullet	
Automatic Languages: Common, Infernal. Bonus Languages: Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Ignan, Terran.
bullet	
Outsider Traits: The voidling is an Outsider (Native).
bullet	
Favored Class: Rogue. A multiclass voidling's rogue class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty. Voidlings keep naturally to the shadows.
bullet	
Level Adjustment: +0. Despite some potent abilities, the voidling is no tougher than a typical character race in the PH.
