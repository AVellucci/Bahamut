#Creating a Wight
#The wight template can be applied to any humanoid, monstrous humanoid, or giant (but see Celebrity Game Table for a version of this template as applied to a dragon). The creature’s type changes to "undead." It uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
 
    Hit Dice: Change to d12.
    Speed: Same as base creature.
    AC: Increase natural armor by +4
   Attacks: The wight retains all the attacks of the base creature and also gains a slam attack if it didn’t already have one.
    Damage: Wights have slam attacks. If the base creature does not have this attack form, use the damage values listed here: Fine/Diminutive 1 pt; Tiny 1d2; Small 1d3; Medium 1d4; Large 1d6; Huge 1d8; Gargantuan 2d6; Colossal 2d8. Creatures with natural attacks retain their old damage ratings or use the values listed above, whichever is better.
    Special Attacks: A wight retains all the special attacks of the base creature and also gains those listed below. Saves have a DC of 10 + 1/2 the wight’s HD + the wight’s Cha modifier.
        Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a wight’s slam attack receive one negative level. A Fortitude save 24 hours later prevents it from becoming permanent.
        Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid, monstrous humanoid, or giant slain by a wight becomes a wight in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death.
    Special Qualities: A wight retains all the special qualities of the base creature and gains the undead type.
        Undead: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and disease. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.
    Saves: Same as base creature
    Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +2, Dex +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As undead creatures, wights have no Con score.
    Skills: Wights gain a +8 racial bonus to Move Silently checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.
    Feats: Wights gain the Blind-Fight feat, assuming the base creature doesn’t already have this feat.
 
 
    Climate/Terrain: Any land and underground
    Organization: Solitary, gang (2-5), or pack (6-11)
    Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1
    Treasure: None
    Alignment: Always lawful evil
    Advancement: By character class
 
Wight Characters
Wights are always lawful evil, which causes characters of certain classes to lose their class abilities, as noted in Chapter 3: Classes in the Player’s Handbook. In addition, certain classes suffer additional penalties.
     Clerics: Clerics lose their ability to turn undead but gain the ability to rebuke undead. This ability does not affect the wight’s creator.
      Wight clerics have access to the Death, Evil, Law, and Trickery domains.
    Sorcerers and Wizards: These characters retain their class abilities, but if a character has a familiar (other than a rat or bat), the link between them is broken, and the familiar shuns its former companion. The character can summon another familiar, but it must be a rat or bat.
