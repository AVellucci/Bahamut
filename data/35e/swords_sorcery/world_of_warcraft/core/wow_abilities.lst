DESC:&nl;Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease and death effects.	DESC:&nl;Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability drain or energy drain.

DESC:&nl;Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless).	DESC:&nl;Uses her Charisma modifi er for Concentration checks.	DESC:&nl;Not at risk of death from massive damage. Unlike other undead, a Forsaken is not destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less. Instead, at 0 hit points a Forsaken is disabled.

She is unconscious and cannot act, but she does not risk further damage (unless her enemies attack her or some other unfortunate event befalls her). At –10 hit points, the Forsaken is destroyed.	DESC:&nl;Not affected by raise dead and reincarnate spells or abilities. Resurrection and true resurrection can affect Forsaken. These spells return a destroyed Forsaken to her undead life; the Scourge’s curse makes it virtually impossible to bring a Forsaken back to life as the creature she was before she died. Only wish or miracle can accomplish that.	DESC:&nl;Forsaken do not breathe, eat or sleep. Forsaken spellcasters still need 8 hours uninterrupted rest before preparing their spells (see Chapter 15: Spellcasting).

Arcane Corruption	KEY:Arcanist ~ Arcane Corruption	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The arcane energy that a necromancer or warlock uses will corrupt her. For every 5 levels of necromancer or warlock the character has, her alignment takes one step toward an evil alignment in line with her current alignment (lawful, neutral, or chaotic). For instance, if Higgins the human necromancer is lawful neutral at 1st level, at 5th level his alignment will shift to Lawful Evil. (For a more detailed arcane corruption variant rules system, see Magic & Mayhem.)
Arcane Path		KEY:Arcanist ~ Arcane Path		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Arcanists take levels in one of three “paths” (mage, necromancer or warlock), with each path casting spells from its own spell list and gaining special abilities that reinforce and enhance its particular brand of magic. Each path also faces certain restrictions when learning and casting spells from the spell list of another path (in the case of multiclassing).	DESC:&nl; All arcanists have these class features based on their chosen paths:	DESC:&nl; An arcanist can cast one additional spell per spell level per day from his specifi c spell list. A multiclassed arcanist must choose the path spell list for his additional spell; the path spell list need not be the same for each spell level. Thus, the arcanist receives only one additional spell per spell level per day, regardless of how many paths in which he has levels.	DESC:&nl; The save DCs of spells from the arcanist’s path spell lists are increased by +1.	DESC:&nl; The arcanist receives a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn spells from his path spell list(s).	DESC:&nl; An arcanist acquires special abilities, called “arcana,” at 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th and 16th level according to his path, as noted in Table 3–3: The Arcanist and described below.	DESC:&nl; Forbidden Arts: While all arcanists can cast spells from the general arcanist spell list, they face certain restrictions when casting spells from another path’s spell list. They cast spells from another path’s spell list with a –2 caster level penalty (minimum caster level 1st, but these penalties stack with those imposed by arcane addiction). The save DCs of such spells are reduced by –2, and there is a 2% chance per spell level of spell failure when casting spells from another path’s spell list. Arcanists cannot learn spells from another path’s spell list unless they have at least one level in that path. (See Chapter 16 for spell lists.) These restrictions apply to all but the arcanist’s current path, which is the path in which she most recently took a level.
Scribe Scroll	KEY:Arcanist ~ Scribe Scroll		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, an arcanist gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.
Bonus Feat		KEY:Arcanist ~ Bonus Feat		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th level, an arcanist gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat or an item creation feat. The arcanist must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.

# Mage Path:
Summon Familiar		KEY:Mage Path ~ 1st Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A mage can obtain a familiar. A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a mage. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills and feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodifi ed animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar. A familiar also grants special abilities to its master, as indicated on Table 3–5. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other. Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master’s level. See the “Familiar Basics” sidebar for more details on summoning familiars.
Call Elemental		KEY:Mage Path ~ 4th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day, the mage can summon an air, earth, fi re or water elemental as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability is similar to summon monster, save that the duration is equal to 5 minutes per point of the mage’s Intellect modifi er. The elemental’s size depends on the mage’s level, as shown on the following table. The mage can use this ability twice per day at 12th level and three times per day at 20th level.
Enhanced Counterspell	KEY:Mage Path ~ 8th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Mages understand the workings of arcane energy so well that they can counter most magic with great effectiveness. When attempting to counter a spell, a mage adds her arcanist path level to her counterspell check. In addition, the mage may counter a spell with any other spell she has prepared as long as it is the same level of the spell being countered and the spell being used to counter is from the same school of magic. Necromancy or conjuration (summoning) spells cannot be counterspelled in this manner by mages. Mages must use dispel magic to counter spells from those schools.
Arcane Adept		KEY:Mage Path ~ 12th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A mage’s dedication to and natural predilection for one of her schools of specialization becomes more entrenched. The mage chooses either evocation or transmutation as a preferred school. She casts spells from this preferred school at +1 caster level, and the save DC for such spells increases by +2.
Fire and Frost		KEY:Mage Path ~ 16th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The mages of Kirin Tor fi rst mastered the arts of casting spells using the elements of ice and fi re. Mages may memorize an additional spell per level as long as it has the cold or fi re elemental descriptor. This additional spell is cast with the effects of the Maximize Spell feat; however, the spell’s level does not change. This ability stacks with the effects of the Maximize Spell feat, which does change the spell’s level.

# Necromancer Path
Death Touch		KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 1st Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By wielding the forces of undeath, the necromancer draws vitality from the living. Death touch is a death effect. The necromancer must succeed on a melee touch attack against a living creature (using the rules for touch spells). When he touches, roll 1d6 per necromancer level he possesses. If the total at least equals the creature’s current hit points, it dies (no save). The necromancer can use this ability once per day at 1st level, twice per day at 9th level, and three times per day at 18th level .
Death Resistance	KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 4th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The necromancer becomes immune to all death spells and magical death effects. This immunity does not protect the necromancer from other sorts of attacks such as hit point loss, poison, petrifi cation or other effects even if they might be lethal.
Animate Dead	KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 8th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The necromancer may animate undead creatures using the vile magic at his disposal. This ability functions like the spell of the same name, but with the following exceptions. The necromancer may use this ability a number of times per day equal to his necromancer levels divided by 2 (1/ day at 1st level). The limit of undead the necromancer can control is equal to 2 Hit Dice per level. The amount of undead controlled by this ability counts toward the number that can be controlled with the animate dead spell as normally cast by the necromancer.
Dark Arts		KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 12th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Necromancers are skilled in wielding magic that causes pain, suffering and death. Mastering the dark arts allows the necromancer to cast spells from the necromancy school at +1 caster level, and the save DC for such spells increases by +2.
Create Undead	KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 16th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The necromancer’s knowledge of undeath reaches such unsurpassed depths that he can create powerful undead. He can use this ability like create undead twice per day or like create greater undead once per day. The ability is cast at the necromancer’s path level.

# Warlock Path:
Fel Companion	KEY:Warlock Path ~ 1st Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, the warlock gains a fel companion. The warlock can summon the fel companion and dismiss it at any time so that he may summon a new one. The fel companion must be an evil outsider with a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than the warlock’s arcanist path level (to a maximum of 10 HD). Should the fel companion die while in service to the warlock, the warlock must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save, at +1 DC for each HD of the companion. If the saving throw fails, the warlock loses 400 XP per warlock level; success reduces the loss to half of that amount. In addition, the warlock must make a DC 15 Will save or take 1d6 points of Stamina damage as the companion’s sudden loss tears away part of the warlock’s life force. A warlock can obtain another fel companion by performing a ceremony of summoning. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp per HD of the creature summoned. The creature serves as a willing companion and servant. Dismissing a fel companion is a free action, and a dismissed creature immediately returns to its plane of origin.
Summoner		KEY:Warlock Path ~ 4th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock receives the Augment Summoning feat for free. At 6th level, all conjuration (summoning) spells cast by the warlock have their durations doubled, as if the Extend Spell feat is applied to them. The level of an augmented conjuration (summoning) spell does not change; this ability stacks with the effect of the Extend Spell feat, which does change the spell’s level (see Chapter 6: Feats).
Enslave Outsider	KEY:Warlock Path ~ 8th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A warlock is adept at convincing outsiders to do his bidding. When a warlock casts lesser planar binding, planar binding, or greater planar binding, he can add his ranks in any one relevant Knowledge skill (the planes, especially the Emerald Dream and the Twisting Nether; demons; the Burning Legion, and so forth) or in Spellcraft, whichever is higher, to the caster level check or the Charisma check made to keep the outsider trapped.
Demonologist	KEY:Warlock Path ~ 12th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The craft of conjuration is the primary focus of the warlock, and in taking on the mantle of a demonologist the warlock sacrifi ces knowledge in other areas of arcane practice. The warlock casts conjuration (summoning) spells at +1 caster level, and the save DC for such spells increases by +2.
Demon Mastery	KEY:Warlock Path ~ 16th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock has learned the compacts and rites necessary to bind a demonic creature to his will. The warlock rebukes and controls outsiders the same as an evil priest rebukes or commands undead. Use the warlock’s arcanist path levels to determine the equivalent of a turning check, and apply the relevant outsider Hit Dice to the undead HD chart (see Chapter 12: Combat, “Turn or Rebuke Undead”). The warlock may also bolster outsiders he controls in the same way that an evil priest bolsters undead. The warlock can attempt to control or rebuke outsiders a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifi er; he may attempt to bolster outsiders that he did not summon himself.
