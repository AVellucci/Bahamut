Your increased caster level affects all level-based variables of the spell, including range, area of effect, spell penetration, and the difficulty of dispelling the spell. You can exceed the normal level-fixed limits of a spell with this feat, so a 9th-level wizard could use Reserves of Strength to cast a fireball as a 12th-level wizard and deal 12d6 points of fire damage.

Normal: Lances deal double damage when used in a mounted charge, but you use your own Strength score to determine the damage bonus. Lances do not have a chance to break in normal combat. Special: You must be armed with a heavy lance or similar weapon (such as a dragonlance). You can use this feat while mounted on a flying creature, such as a dragon.
