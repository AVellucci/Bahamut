Runescarring	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:You can scribe up to 7 scars onto your body (2 each on Chest, Upper Arms, Back of Hands and 1 on the face), each imbued with a spell like ability. Scribing a runescar takes 1 hour and costs (5GP * Spell Lvl * Caster Lvl), and also costs XP equal to 1/25th the GP spent. Each scar deals 1d6 damage per spell level when scribed. It takes a standard action to touch the rune to activate it.	SOURCEPAGE:p.32
