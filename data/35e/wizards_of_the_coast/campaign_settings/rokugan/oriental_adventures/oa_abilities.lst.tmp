HENGEYOKAI RACIAL TRAITS
. -2 Wisdom. Hengeyokai tend to be flighty and weak-willed. A hengeyokai's physical ability scores vary widely in its animal and hybrid forms; the character's generated ability scores apply to its human form. In hybrid form, a hengeyokai gains a +2 adjustment to one physical ability score, as shown on Table 1-2: Hengeyokai Hybrid Forms.

character level. Thus, a 1st-level hengeyokai can switch from

polymorph other), and magic items cease functioning while
the hengeyokai remains in animal form. In animal form, the
