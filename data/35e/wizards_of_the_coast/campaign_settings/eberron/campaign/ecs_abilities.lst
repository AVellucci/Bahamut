. Natural Linguist: Changelings add Speak Language to their list of class skills for any class they adopt.
. Minor Change Shape (Su): Changelings have the super natural ability to alter their appearance as though using a disguise self spell that affects their bodies but not their possessions. This ability is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of a changeling's facial features, skin color and texture, and size, within the limits described for the spell. A changeling can use this ability at will, and the alteration lasts until she changes shape again. A changeling reverts to her natural form when killed. A true seeing spell reveals her natural form. When using this ability to create a disguise, a changeling receives a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. Using this ability is a full-round action.

Psi-Like Abilities	KEY:Psi-Like Abilities ~ Kalashtar	SOURCEPAGE:p.	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.XXXRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:Mindlink (1/day). This ability is like the power manifested by a wilder of 1/2 the kalashtar's Hit Dice (minimum 1st level). If you are not using the Expanded Psionics Handbook in your game, use this description of the mindlink power: You forge a telepathic bond with another creature within 30 feet, which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. The bond can be established only with a willing subject, who therefore receives no saving throw and gains no benefit from spell resistance. You can communicate telepathically through the bond even if you do not share a common language. No special power or infl uence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another), but only lasts for 1 round per character level. This is a mind-affecting ability.

SHIFTER RACIAL TRAITS	SOURCEPAGE:p.19
. Shapechanger Subtype: Shifters are humanoids with the shapechanger subtype.
. +2 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma: Shifters are lithe and agile, but their fundamental bestial nature detracts from both their reasoning ability and their social interaction.
. Medium: As Medium creatures, shifters have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
. Shifter base land speed is 30 feet.
. Shifting (Su)	KEY: ~ 	SOURCEPAGE:p.	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.XXXRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:A shifter can tap into her lycanthropic heritage to gain short bursts of physical power. Once per day, a shifter can enter a state that is superfi cially similar to a barbarian's rage. Each shifter has one of six shifter traits-characteristics that manifest themselves when a character is shifting. Each shifter trait provides a +2 bonus to one of the character's physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) and grants some other advantage as well. Shifter traits are described in the following section. Shifting is a free action and lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the shifter's Con modifi er. (If a shifter trait or other effect increases the character's Con modifi er, use the newly improved modifi er.) A shifter can take feats to improve this ability. These shifter feats are described in Chapter 3: Heroic Characteristics. Every shifter feat a character takes in creases the duration of shifting by 1 round. For every two shifter feats a character takes, the number of times per day she can tap into the ability increases by one. So, a character with two shifter feats can shift two times per day (instead of the usual one), and each use of the ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 (instead of 3) + the shifter's Con modifi er. Shifting, though related to and developed from lycanthropy, is neither an aff liction nor a curse. It is not passed on by bite or claw attacks, and a shifter can't be cured-shifting is a natural ability for the race.
. Low-Light Vision: Shifters can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
. +2 racial bonus on Balance, Climb, and Jump checks: A shifter's animalistic heritage enhances many of her physical skills.
. Automatic Languages: Common. Bonus Languages: Elven, Gnome, Halfl ing, and Sylvan.
. Favored Class: Ranger. A multiclass shifter's ranger class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.

Beasthide (Su)	KEY:Shifter Traits ~ Beasthide	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.XXXRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:While shifting, a beasthide shifter gains a +2 bonus to Constitution and natural armor that provides a +2 bonus to AC.
Longtooth (Su)	KEY:Shifter Traits ~ Longtooth	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.XXXRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:While shifting, a longtooth shifter gains a +2 bonus to Strength and grows fangs that can be used as a natural weapon, dealing 1d6 points of damage (plus an additional +1 for every four character levels she has) with a successful bite attack. She cannot attack more than once per round with her bite, even if her base attack bonus is high enough to give her multiple attacks. She can use her bite as a secondary attack (taking a -5 penalty on her attack roll) while wielding a weapon.
Cliffwalk (Su)	KEY:Shifter Traits ~ Cliffwalk	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.XXXRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:While shifting, a cliffwalk shifter gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity and has a climb speed of 20 feet.
Razorclaw (Su)	KEY:Shifter Traits ~ Razorclaw	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.XXXRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:While shifting, a razorclaw shifter gains a +2 bonus to Strength and grows claws that can be used as natural weapons. These claws deal 1d4 points of damage (plus an additional +1 for every four character levels she has) with each successful attack. She can attack with one claw as a standard action or with two claws as a full attack action (as a primary natural weapon). She can not attack more than once per round with a single claw, even if her base attack bonus is high enough to give her multiple attacks. She can attack with a claw as a light off-hand weapon while wielding a weapon in her primary hand, but all her attacks in that round take a -2 penalty.
Longstride (Su)	KEY:Shifter Traits ~ Longstride	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.XXXRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:While shifting, a longstride shifter gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity and a bonus of +10 feet to her base land speed.
Wildhunt (Su)	KEY:Shifter Traits ~ Wildhunt		SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.XXXRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:While shifting, a wildhunt shifter gains a +2 bonus to Constitution and the scent ability. This ability allows the shifter to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. A wildhunt shifter can identify familiar odors just as a human does familiar sights. A wildhunt shifter can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. These stronger scents block other scents, so they can sometimes be used to confuse or hamper this shifter trait. When a wildhunt shifter detects a scent, the exact location of the source isn't revealed-only its presence somewhere within range. The shifter can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever the shifter comes within 5 feet of the source, she pinpoints the source's location. While shifting, a wildhunt shifter who has the Track feat can follow tracks by smell, making Survival checks to find or follow a trail. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (regardless of the surface that holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures producing the odor, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail grows cold, the DC increases by 2. This ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Shifters tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility. When not shifting, a wildhunt shifter gains a +2 bonus on Survival checks due to the lingering effects of the scent ability.	BONUS:SKILL|Survival|2

# Warforged

Composite Plating	KEY:Composite Plating ~ Warforged	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.XXXRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:The plating used to build a warforged provides a +2 armor bonus. This plating is not natural armor and does not stack with other effects that give an armor bonus (other than natural armor). This composite plating occupies the same space on the body as a suit of armor or a robe, and thus a warforged cannot wear armor or magic robes. Warforged can be enchanted just as armor can be. The character must be present for the entire time it takes to enchant him. Composite plating also provides a warforged with a 5% arcane spell failure chance, similar to the penalty for wearing light armor. Any class ability that allows a warforged to ignore the arcane spell failure chance for light armor lets him ignore this penalty as well.

Light Fortification (Ex)	KEY:Light Fortification ~ Warforged	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.XXXRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on a warforged, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.
. A warforged has a natural weapon in the form of a slam attack that deals 1d4 points of damage.	NATURALATTACKS:Slam,Weapon.Natural.Melee.Bludgeoning,*1,1d4
. Automatic Languages: Common. Bonus Languages: None.
. Favored Class: Fighter. A multiclass warforged's fighter class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.
