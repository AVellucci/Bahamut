Changeling Racial Traits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	TYPE:ChangelingRacialTrait.RacialTrait.SpecialQuality	ASPECT:RaceTraitMaster|RacialTrait	DESC:Shapechanger Subtype: Changelings are humanoids with the shapechanger subtype.	DESC:&nl;Medium: As Medium creatures, changelings have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.	DESC:&nl;Changeling base land speed is 30 feet.	DESC:&nl;+2 racial bonus on saving throws a gainst sleep and charm effects: Changelings have slippery minds.		DESC:&nl;+2 racial bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks: Changelings are inherently skilled in deception and intimidation, and though they cannot actually detect thoughts as doppelgangers can, they can intuitively read body language and attitude with surprising accuracy.	DESC:&nl;Natural Linguist: Changelings add Speak Language to their list of class skills for any class they adopt.	DESC:&nl;Minor Change Shape (Su): Changelings have the super natural ability to alter their appearance as though using a disguise self spell that affects their bodies but not their possessions. This ability is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of a changeling's facial features, skin color and texture, and size, within the limits described for the spell. A changeling can use this ability at will, and the alteration lasts until she changes shape again. A changeling reverts to her natural form when killed. A true seeing spell reveals her natural form. When using this ability to create a disguise, a changeling receives a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. Using this ability is a full-round action.	DESC:&nl;Automatic Languages: Common.

Kalashtar Racial Traits		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.KalashtarRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:&nl;Medium: As Medium creatures, kalashtar have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.	DESC:&nl;Kalashtar base land speed is 30 feet.	DESC:&nl;+2 racial bonus on sav ing throws a gainst mind-affecting spells and abilities, and possession: The kalashtar's dual spirits help them resist spells that target their minds.	DESC:&nl;+2 racial bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks: Kalashtar are masters of social interaction, influencing others through their commanding presence and subtle psychic powers.	DESC:&nl;+2 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate a human: Kalashtar have a close physical resemblance to humans.	DESC:&nl;Kalashtar sleep but they do not dream. As such, they have immunity to the dream and nightmare spells, as well as any other effect that relies on the target's ability to dream.
Naturally Psionic			KEY:Kalashtar ~ Naturally Psionic	SOURCEPAGE:p.	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.KalashtarRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:Kalashtar gain 1 extra power point per character level, regardless of whether they choose a psionic class.
Psi-Like Abilities		KEY:Kalashtar ~ Psi-Like Abilities	SOURCEPAGE:p.	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.KalashtarRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:Mindlink (1/day). This ability is like the power manifested by a wilder of 1/2 the kalashtar's Hit Dice (minimum 1st level). If you are not using the Expanded Psionics Handbook in your game, use this description of the mindlink power: You forge a telepathic bond with another creature within 30 feet, which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. The bond can be established only with a willing subject, who therefore receives no saving throw and gains no benefit from spell resistance. You can communicate telepathically through the bond even if you do not share a common language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another), but only lasts for 1 round per character level. This is a mind-affecting ability.



Racial Traits ~ Shifter	CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE.ShifterRaceTrait

Shifter Racial Traits	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.ShifterRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:&nl;Shapechanger Subtype: Shifters are humanoids with the shapechanger subtype.	DESC:&nl;+2 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma: Shifters are lithe and agile, but their fundamental bestial nature detracts from both their reasoning ability and their social interaction.	DESC:&nl;Medium: As Medium creatures, shifters have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.	DESC:&nl;Shifter base land speed is 30 feet.	DESC:&nl;Shifting (Su): A shifter can tap into her lycanthropic heritage to gain short bursts of physical power. Once per day, a shifter can enter a state that is superficially similar to a barbarian's rage. Each shifter has one of six shifter traits-characteristics that manifest themselves when a character is shifting. Each shifter trait provides a +2 bonus to one of the character's physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) and grants some other advantage as well. Shifter traits are described in the following section. Shifting is a free action and lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the shifter's Con modifier. (If a shifter trait or other effect increases the character's Con modifier, use the newly improved modifier.) A shifter can take feats to improve this ability. These shifter feats are described in Chapter 3: Heroic Characteristics. Every shifter feat a character takes in creases the duration of shifting by 1 round. For every two shifter feats a character takes, the number of times per day she can tap into the ability increases by one. So, a character with two shifter feats can shift two times per day (instead of the usual one), and each use of the ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 (instead of 3) + the shifter's Con modifier. Shifting, though related to and developed from lycanthropy, is neither an aff liction nor a curse. It is not passed on by bite or claw attacks, and a shifter can't be cured-shifting is a natural ability for the race.	DESC:&nl;Low-Light Vision: Shifters can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.	DESC:&nl;+2 racial bonus on Balance, Climb, and Jump checks: A shifter's animalistic heritage enhances many of her physical skills.	DESC:&nl;Automatic Languages: Common. Bonus Languages: Elven, Gnome, Halfling, and Sylvan.	DESC:&nl;Favored Class: Ranger. A multiclass shifter's ranger class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.

Beasthide	KEY:Shifter Traits ~ Beasthide	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.RaceTrait.ShifterSelection.SpecialQuality	DESC:While shifting, a beasthide shifter gains a +2 bonus to Constitution and natural armor that provides a +2 bonus to AC.
Longtooth	KEY:Shifter Traits ~ Longtooth	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.RaceTrait.ShifterSelection.SpecialQuality	DESC:While shifting, a longtooth shifter gains a +2 bonus to Strength and grows fangs that can be used as a natural weapon, dealing 1d6 points of damage (plus an additional +1 for every four character levels she has) with a successful bite attack. She cannot attack more than once per round with her bite, even if her base attack bonus is high enough to give her multiple attacks. She can use her bite as a secondary attack (taking a -5 penalty on her attack roll) while wielding a weapon.
Cliffwalk	KEY:Shifter Traits ~ Cliffwalk	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.RaceTrait.ShifterSelection.SpecialQuality	DESC:While shifting, a cliffwalk shifter gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity and has a climb speed of 20 feet.
Razorclaw	KEY:Shifter Traits ~ Razorclaw	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.RaceTrait.ShifterSelection.SpecialQuality	DESC:While shifting, a razorclaw shifter gains a +2 bonus to Strength and grows claws that can be used as natural weapons. These claws deal 1d4 points of damage (plus an additional +1 for every four character levels she has) with each successful attack. She can attack with one claw as a standard action or with two claws as a full attack action (as a primary natural weapon). She can not attack more than once per round with a single claw, even if her base attack bonus is high enough to give her multiple attacks. She can attack with a claw as a light off-hand weapon while wielding a weapon in her primary hand, but all her attacks in that round take a -2 penalty.
Longstride	KEY:Shifter Traits ~ Longstride	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.RaceTrait.ShifterSelection.SpecialQuality	DESC:While shifting, a longstride shifter gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity and a bonus of +10 feet to her base land speed.
Wildhunt	KEY:Shifter Traits ~ Wildhunt		SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.RaceTrait.ShifterSelection.SpecialQuality	DESC:While shifting, a wildhunt shifter gains a +2 bonus to Constitution and the scent ability. This ability allows the shifter to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. A wildhunt shifter can identify familiar odors just as a human does familiar sights. A wildhunt shifter can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. These stronger scents block other scents, so they can sometimes be used to confuse or hamper this shifter trait. When a wildhunt shifter detects a scent, the exact location of the source isn't revealed-only its presence somewhere within range. The shifter can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever the shifter comes within 5 feet of the source, she pinpoints the source's location. While shifting, a wildhunt shifter who has the Track feat can follow tracks by smell, making Survival checks to find or follow a trail. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (regardless of the surface that holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures producing the odor, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail grows cold, the DC increases by 2. This ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Shifters tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility. When not shifting, a wildhunt shifter gains a +2 bonus on Survival checks due to the lingering effects of the scent ability.	BONUS:SKILL|Survival|2

# Warforged

Composite Plating	KEY:Composite Plating ~ Warforged	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.WarforgedRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:The plating used to build a warforged provides a +2 armor bonus. This plating is not natural armor and does not stack with other effects that give an armor bonus (other than natural armor). This composite plating occupies the same space on the body as a suit of armor or a robe, and thus a warforged cannot wear armor or magic robes. Warforged can be enchanted just as armor can be. The character must be present for the entire time it takes to enchant him. Composite plating also provides a warforged with a 5% arcane spell failure chance, similar to the penalty for wearing light armor. Any class ability that allows a warforged to ignore the arcane spell failure chance for light armor lets him ignore this penalty as well.

Light Fortification	KEY:Light Fortification ~ Warforged	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.RaceTrait.WarforgedRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on a warforged, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.	DESC:&nl;A warforged has a natural weapon in the form of a slam attack that deals 1d4 points of damage.	NATURALATTACKS:Slam,Weapon.Natural.Melee.Bludgeoning,*1,1d4	DESC:&nl;Automatic Languages: Common. Bonus Languages: None.	DESC:&nl;Favored Class: Fighter. A multiclass warforged's fighter class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.


###Classes

# Artificer
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Artificer ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ArtificerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Artificers are proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields).
Infusions				KEY:Artificer ~ Infusions	SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ArtificerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An artificer is not a spellcaster, but he does have the ability to imbue items with magical infusions. Infusions are neither arcane nor divine; they are drawn from the artificer infusion list (see Chapter 5: Magic). They function just like spells and follow all the rules for spells. For example, an infusion can be dispelled, it will not function in an antimagic area, and an artificer must make a Concentration check if injured while imbuing an item with an infusion. An artificer can imbue an item with any infusion from the list without preparing the infusion ahead of time. Unlike a sorcerer or bard, he does not select a subset of the available infusions as his known infusions; he has access to every infusion on the list that is of a level he can use. It is possible for an artificer to learn infusions that are not on the normal artificer infusion list. These might include ancient infusions he finds in the ruins of Xen'drik or secret infusions known only to the members of certain guilds or organizations. When he encounters such an infusion, an artificer can attempt to learn it by making a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level). If this check succeeds, he adds the infusion to his list. If not, he can try again when he gains another rank in Spellcraft, assuming he still has access to the new infusion. To imbue an item with an infusion, an artificer must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the infusion level (Int 11 for 1st-level infusions, Int 12 for 2nd-level infusions, and so forth). Infusions never allow saving throws. Like spellcasters, an artificer can use only a certain number of infusions of a particular level per day. His base daily infusion allotment is given on the accompanying table. In addition, he receives extra infusions per day if he has a sufficiently high Intelligence score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the Player's Handbook). An artificer's infusions can only be imbued into an item or a construct (including warforged). He can not, for example, simply imbue an ally with bull's strength. He must instead imbue that ability into an item his ally is wearing. The item then functions as a belt of giant strength for the duration of the infusion. He can, however, imbue bull's strength directly on a construct or a character with the living construct subtype, and infusions such as repair light damage and iron construct function only when imbued on such characters. Many infusions have long casting times, often 1 minute or more. An artificer can spend 1 action point to imbue any infusion in 1 round (like a spell that takes 1 round to cast). Like a spellcaster, an artificer can apply item creation feats and metamagic feats to his infusions. Like a sorcerer, an artificer can apply a metamagic feat to an infusion spontaneously, but doing this requires extra time. An artificer can craft alchemical items as though he were a spellcaster. An artificer cannot automatically use a spell trigger or spell completion item if the equivalent spell appears on his infusion list. For example, an artificer must still employ the Use Magic Device skill to use a wand of light, even though light appears on his infusion list. Each day, an artificer must focus his mind on his infusions. He needs 8 hours of rest, after which he spends 15 minutes concentrating. During this period, the artifi- cer readies his mind to hold his daily allotment of infusions. Without such a period of time to refresh himself, the character does not regain the infusion slots he used up the day before. Any infusions used within the last 8 hours count against the artificer's daily limit.
Craft Reserve			KEY:Artificer ~ Craft Reserve	SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ArtificerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An artificer receives a pool of points he can spend instead of experience points when crafting a magic item. Each time the artificer gains a new level, he receives a new craft reserve; leftover points from the previous level do not carry over. If the points are not spent, they are lost. An artificer can also use his craft reserve to supplement the XP cost of the item he is making, taking a portion of the cost from his craft reserve and a portion from his own XP.

Artificer Knowledge		KEY:Artificer ~ Artificer Knowledge	SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ArtificerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An artificer can make a special artificer knowledge check with a bonus equal to his artificer level + his Int modifier to detect whether a specific item has a magical aura. The artificer must hold and examine the object for 1 minute. A successful check against DC 15 determines that the object has magical qualities, but does not reveal the specific powers of the item. An artificer cannot take 10 or take 20 on this check. A particular item can only be examined in this fashion one time; if the check fails, the artificer can learn no more about that object.
Artisan Bonus			KEY:Artificer ~ Artisan Bonus	SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ArtificerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An artificer gains a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks to activate an item of a kind for which he has the prerequisite item creation feat. For example, an artificer who has the Craft Wand feat gains a +2 bonus on checks to use a spell from a wand.
Disable Trap			KEY:Artificer ~ Disable Trap	SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ArtificerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An artificer can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create the trap. An artificer can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. Usually the DC is 25 + the level of the spell used to create the trap. An artificer who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with his party) without disarming it.
Item Creation			KEY:Artificer ~ Item Creation	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.ArtificerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An artificer can create a magic item even if he does not have access to the spells that are prerequisites for the item. The artificer must make a successful Use Magic Device check (DC 20 + caster level) to emulate each spell normally required to create the item. Thus, to make a 1st-level wand of magic missile, an artificer would need a Use Magic Device check result of 21 or higher. To create a bottle of air (caster level 7th), he would need a check result of 27 or higher to emulate the water breathing prerequisite. The artificer must make a successful check for each prerequisite for each item he makes. If he fails a check, he can try again each day until the item is complete (see Creating Magic Items, page 282 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If he comes to the end of the crafting time and he has still not successfully emulated one of the powers, he can make one final check-his last-ditch effort, even if he has already made a check that day. If that check also fails, then the creation process fails and the time, money, and XP expended to craft the item are lost. For purposes of meeting item prerequisites, an artificer's effective caster level equals his artificer level +2. If the item duplicates a spell effect, however, it uses the artificer's actual level as its caster level. Costs are always determined using the item's minimum caster level or the artificer's actual level (if it is higher). Thus, a 3rd-level artificer can make a scroll of fireball, since the minimum caster level for fireball is 5th. He pays the normal cost for making such a scroll with a caster level of 5th: 5 ? 3 ? 12.5 = 187 gp and 5 sp, plus 15 XP. But the scroll's actual caster level is only 3rd, and it produces a weak fireball that deals only 3d6 points of damage. An artificer can also make Use Magic Device checks to emulate nonspell requirements, including alignment and race, using the normal DCs for the skill. He cannot emulate skill or feat requirements, however, including item creation feat prerequisites. He must meet the caster level prerequisite, including the minimum level to cast a spell he stores in a potion, wand, or scroll. An artificer's infusions do not meet spell prerequisites for creating magic items. For example, an artificer must still employ the Use Magic Device skill to emulate the light spell to create a wand of light, even though light appears on his infusion list.
Bonus Feat				KEY:Artificer ~ Bonus Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ArtificerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An artificer gains every item creation feat as a bonus feat at or near the level at which it becomes available to spellcasters. He gets Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat at 1st level, Brew Potion at 2nd level, Craft Wondrous Item at 3rd level, Craft Magic Arms and Armor at 5th level, Craft Wand at 7th level, Craft Rod at 9th level, Craft Staff at 12th level, and Forge Ring at 14th level. In addition, an artificer gains a bonus feat at 4th level and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th). For each of these bonus feats, the artificer must choose a metamagic feat or a feat from the following list: Attune Magic Weapon, Craft Construct (see the Monster Manual, page 303), Exceptional Artisan, Extra Rings, Extraordinary Artisan, Legendary Artisan, Wand Mastery.

Craft Homunculus			KEY:Artificer ~ Craft Homunculus	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.ArtificerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level, an artificer can create a homunculus as if he had the Craft Construct feat. He must emulate the spell requirements (arcane eye, mending, and mirror image) as normal for making a magic item, and he must pay all the usual gold and XP costs (though he can spend points from his craft reserve). An artificer can also upgrade an existing homunculus that he owns, adding 1 Hit Die at a cost of 2,000 gp and 160 XP. If an artificer gives his homunculus more than 6 Hit Dice, it becomes a Small creature and advances as described in the Monster Manual (+4 Str, -2 Dex, damage increases to 1d6). The homunculus also gains 10 extra hit points for being a Small construct. An artificer's homunculus can have as many Hit Dice as its master's Hit Dice minus 2. No matter how many Hit Dice it has, a homunculus never grows larger than Small.
Retain Essence			KEY:Artificer ~ Retain Essence	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.ArtificerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, an artificer gains the ability to salvage the XP from a magic item and use those points to create another magic item. The artificer must spend a day with the item, and he must also have the appropriate item creation feat for the item he is salvaging. After one day, the item is destroyed and the artificer adds the XP it took to create the item to his craft reserve. These points are lost if the artificer does not use them before gaining his next level. For example, an artificer wants to retain the essence of a wand of summon monster IV that has 20 charges. Originally created (like all wands) with 50 charges, it required 840 XP when initially made, or 16.8 XP (840 ? 50) per charge. The artificer is able to recover the XP from the remaining charges. He puts 336 XP (16.8 ? 20) into his craft reserve.
Metamagic Spell Trigger		KEY:Artificer ~ Metamagic Spell Trigger	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.ArtificerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 6th level, an artificer gains the ability to apply a metamagic feat he knows to a spell trigger item (generally a wand). He must have the appropriate item creation feat for the spell trigger item he is using. Using this ability expends additional charges from the item equal to the number of effective spell levels the metamagic feat would add to a spell. For example, an artificer can quicken a spell cast from a wand by spending 5 charges (4 additional charges), empower the spell by spending 3 charges, or trigger it silently by spending 2 charges. The Still Spell feat confers no benefit when applied to a spell trigger item. An artificer cannot use this ability when using a spell trigger item that does not have charges, such as prayer beads.
Metamagic Spell Completion	KEY:Artificer ~ Metamagic Spell Completion	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.ArtificerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 11th level, an artificer gains the ability to apply a metamagic feat he knows to a spell completion item (generally a scroll). He must have the appropriate item creation feat for the spell completion item he is using. The DC for the Use Magic Device check is equal to 20 + (3 ? the modified level of the spell). For example, applying the Empower Spell feat to a scroll of cone of cold, creating a 7th-level effect, has a DC of 20 + (3 ? 7), or 41. An artificer can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Int modifier.
Skill Mastery			KEY:Artificer ~ Skill Mastery	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ArtificerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 13th level, an artificer can take 10 when making a Spellcraft or Use Magic Device check, even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him from doing so. This ability circumvents the normal rule that a character may not take 10 on a Use Magic Device check.

# Druid Sect
Ashbound			KEY:Druid Sect ~ Ashbound			SOURCEPAGE:p.75	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Druid SectClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:This fanatical sect takes the traditional beliefs of the druids to dangerous extremes. Its members seek to protect the wilds and preserve the natural order, using a very broad defi nition of "unnatural" to determine their actions. They consider arcane and divine magic to be unnatural, for example, and go out of their way to strike at farms and ranches that attempt to confi ne or cultivate nature. The Ashbound prefer to avoid killing; their goal is to encourage their targets to abandon their unnatural ways and embrace the harmony of nature.
Children of Winter	KEY:Druid Sect ~ Children of Winter		SOURCEPAGE:p.75	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Druid SectClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Death, being a part of the natural order, draws some to its dark source of power. The Children of Winter seek to cleanse the land through blight, disease, and cold, believing that the strong will survive to populate the great spring that lies beyond their dark winter. The end of the current age is coming, as evidenced by the creation of the Mournland, and the Children of Winter see themselves as agents of nature-cleansing Khorvaire so that it can bloom anew.
Gatekeepers			KEY:Druid Sect ~ Gatekeepers			SOURCEPAGE:p.75	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Druid SectClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The Gatekeepers protect nature from unnatural threats, specifi cally aberrations, fi ends, and other ancient evils. See Chapter 8: Organizations for additional information about this druid sect.
Greensingers		KEY:Druid Sect ~ Greensingers			SOURCEPAGE:p.75	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Druid SectClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:This small druid sect maintains a strong bond with the fey of the Eldeen Reaches. As wild and chaotic as the forest spirits they revere, the Greensingers embrace revelry as they dance through the magical world of the forest and the fey.
