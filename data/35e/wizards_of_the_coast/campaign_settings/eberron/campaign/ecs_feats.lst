Monastic Training	TYPE:General.Monk.MonkLVL1.MonkLVL2.MonkLVL6	SOURCEPAGE:p.57	DESC:You are part of an order that combines the monastic discipline of the monk class with another form of training.	BENEFIT:Pick one class. Taking levels in this class does not prevent you from taking monk levels. If you take levels in any other class, you lose your ability to progress as a monk as usual. If the selected class also has restricted advancement, such as the paladin class, taking monk levels does not prevent you from advancing in that class. Special: A monk can take this feat as his bonus feat at 1st, 2nd, or 6th level.	MULT:YES	STACK:NO	CHOOSE:CLASS|TYPE=PC.TYPE=Base


#Ebberon Campaign Setting Feats

Aberrant Dragonmark	TYPE:General	DESC:Although you are not a recognized member of one of the dragonmarked families, you have manifested a dragonmark.	PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Dragonmarked,Human%,Dwarf%,Elf%,Gnome%,Halfling%,Half-Orc%	BENEFIT:This feat provides you with a single dragonmark spell-like ability that is not directly tied to the trueborn dragonmarked houses. All aberrant mark spell-like abilities can be used once per day. When you select this feat, you must choose an aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability from the following list. You can never improve this mark in any way, and you can never gain a second mark. A character with one of the true marks (least, lesser, or greater) cannot select this feat, and a character with this feat cannot later select one of the true dragonmark feats. A saving throw against your aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability has a DC of 10 + spell level + your Cha modifier. (Spell level for an aberrant dragonmark is always 1st.) Your caster level for your aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability is one-half your character level. Aberrant Mark Powers: burning hands, cause fear, charm person, chill touch, detect secret doors, feather fall, inflict light wounds, jump, light, pass without trace, produce flame, shield, Tenser's floating disk. Aberrant dragonmarks are mutations that appear occasionally among the dragonmarked races (usually to those not of a dragonmarked house) that can be traced back to the bloodlines of corrupted dragonmarked families eliminated in the War of the Mark. At a quick glance, an aberrant mark could be mistaken for an established dragonmark, but on close inspection its differences are readily apparent.
Action Boost		TYPE:General	DESC:You have the ability to alter your luck drastically in dire circumstances.	BENEFIT:When you spend an action point to alter the result of an attack roll, a skill check, an ability check, a level check, or a saving throw, you roll d8s instead of d6s and add the result to the d20 roll.
Action Surge		TYPE:General	DESC:By spending 2 action points, you can perform an additional action in a round.	PREMULT:1,[PREATT:3],[PREVARGTEQ:BaseAttackBonus,3]	BENEFIT:You can spend 2 action points to take an extra move or standard action in a round, either before or after your regular actions.
Adamantine Body		TYPE:Warforged	DESC:At the cost of mobility, a warforged character's body can be crafted with a layer of adamantine that provides formidable protective armor and some damage reduction.	PRERACE:1,Warforged	PRETEXT:1st level only.	BENEFIT:Your armor bonus is increased to +8 and you gain damage reduction 2/adamantine. However, your base land speed is reduced to 20 feet, and you are considered to be wearing heavy armor. You have a +1 maximum Dexterity bonus to AC, a -5 penalty on all skill checks that armor check penalties apply to (Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, Swim, and Tumble), and an arcane spell failure chance of 35%%. Normal: Without this feat, your warforged character has an armor bonus of +2. Special: Unlike most feats, this feat must be taken at 1st level, during character creation. Warforged druids who take this feat cannot cast druid spells or use any of the druid's supernatural or spell-like class features. Warforged characters with this feat do not gain the benefit of any class feature prohibited to a character wearing heavy armor.
