Vestment of Many Styles		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Shirt		COST:5000		WT:3		MODS:NO		SOURCEPAGE:p.172	SPROP:This suit of clothes transforms itself into different fabrics and designs, allowing the wearer to alter her outward appearance with a command word.  The vestment grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks in any situation where clothing is part of the disguise (so that it wouldn't help disguise a sorcerer who had shapechanged into a red dragon, for example), but does not change or disguise any armor worn.
