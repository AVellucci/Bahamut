Armor of the Unending Hunt	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:This mithral +2 chainmail armor was built by the elves for rangers on long-range patrols. In addition to its protective qualities, it provides the wearer with immunity to fatigue and exhaustion. Moderate Abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, restoration	COST:21,500 gp; Cost 10,900 gp + 848 XP	WT:20	

# Weapon
Burrowing Arrow		BASEITEM:Arrow	TYPE:Enhancement.Ammunition.SpecificArrow.Individual	COST:167	WT:0		EQMOD:STEEL.WOOD.MWORKW.PLUS1W	MODS:NO	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:This +1 arrow sticks into its target on a successful hit and embeds itself in the wound. A burrowing arrow must be pulled out before natural healing can occur, and this removal deals a further 1d8 points of damage. If the target receives magical healing, the burrowing arrow immediately deals 1d8 points of damage as the magic forces it out of the wound. Faint necromancy; CL 4th
Lance of the Last Rider		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Lance	TYPE:Enhancement.Weapon.Melee.Martial.Reach.Specific.Piercing.Lance	COST:10	WT:10	WIELD:TwoHanded		SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d8	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x3	EQMOD:WOOD.MWORKW.PLUS1W	REACHMULT:2					MODS:NO	SPROP:When mounted, free bull rush against attempt when hit a mounted foe.	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:Whenever the wielder of this +1 lance charges a mounted foe from the back of a steed, the weapon allows a free bull rush attempt on a successful hit. If the bull rush attempt succeeds, the enemy rider moves back, but the enemy's mount stays where it is. Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bull's strength	COST:8,306 gp; Cost 4,306 gp + 320 XP.
Oglien's Final Answer	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:This +2 spiked chain has a glittering sheen, but most spellcasters don't identify it as magic due to the persistent nondetection effect on it. A DC 25 Spellcraft check is required for a spellcaster to detect the magic of Oglien's final answer. The weapon gives its wielder a +5 bonus on Perform (weapon drill) checks. (See the section on skills near the end of Chapter 3.) Oglien, a noted gladiator from a bygone age, used his "final answer" to get an edge in the arena. Since his death, the weapon has passed from gladiator to gladiator, with many unaware of its magical nature. Moderate transmutation and abjuration; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, nondetection	COST:26,325 gp; Cost 13,325 gp + 1,040 XP.

# Wondrous Item
Bracers of Dawn			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Bracer	COST:26000	WT:1.00		SOURCEPAGE:p.135		MODS:NO	ABILITY:Special Ability|VIRTUAL|Belt of the Champion Ability	SPROP:These bejeweled bracers have a miniscule lens-and-dial contraption mounted on the exterior of one bracer of the pair. When the dial is turned to the left, the bracers appear normal. When the wearer turns the dial to the middle position (a move action), a beam of light emerges from the lens, illuminating the surroundings as a bullseye lantern. Four times per day, the wearer can turn the dial to the right position as a standard action and aim the lens at a target, unleashing a beam of searing light that deals 3d8 points of damage to most creatures, 6d6 points of damage to undead, and 6d8 points of damage to creatures with light sensitivity. The dial returns to the middle position after each searing light. Even though only one of the pair contains the lens-anddial apparatus, both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective. Moderate evocation, CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, searing light	COST:26000	WT:1	
Gauntlet of the Dwarven Forge	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	TYPE:Equip.Gauntlet.Glove.Magic	SPROP:This iron gauntlet extends to the elbow and is always cool to its wearer's touch. When its command word is spoken, a gauntlet of the dwarven forge glows red-hot for 10 rounds, illuminating everything within 10 feet as if by torchlight. Anyone else touched by the gauntlet during this time takes 1d6+10 points of fire damage. The wearer of a gauntlet of the dwarven forge takes half damage from fire-based attacks while the gauntlet is glowing. Fire attacks that allow Reflex saves for half damage deal the wearer no damage if he makes his save. Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, fire shield	COST:24000	WT:3	
Gauntlet of Lassitude		SOURCEPAGE:p.135	TYPE:Equip.Gauntlet.Glove.Magic	SPROP:This leather glove bound in brass magically transforms to match the hand shape of its owner, and thus it can be worn on either hand. With a successful melee touch attack, the gauntlet of lassitude slows the target for 5 rounds (Will DC 14 negates). Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, slow	COST:27000	WT:2	
Gauntlet of Utterdeath		SOURCEPAGE:p.136	TYPE:Equip.Gauntlet.Glove.Magic	SPROP:This spiked gauntlet of jet-black steel smells faintly of brimstone. If the wearer succeeds on a melee touch attack, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be reduced to a pile of smoldering cinders. If the Fortitude save succeeds, the target instead takes 10d6 points of damage. A gauntlet of utterdeath is usable three times per day. Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, destruction	COST:96000	WT:2	
Sacred Scabbard			SOURCEPAGE:p.136	TYPE:Equip.Scabbard.Magic.Container	CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon=1	SPROP:This item has a variable appearance. When first found, there is a 25%% chance it looks like a dagger sheath, a 25%% chance it looks like an axe case, and a 50%% chance it looks like some sort of sword sheath. A user quickly discovers, however, that a sacred scabbard can change shape to fit whatever dagger, sword, or axe is touched to it, even making allowances for double weapons. This scabbard keeps any weapon carried in it clean and sharp. In addition, up to three times per day, the user may place a weapon in the scabbard, utter a command word, and invoke bless weapon on the weapon inside. Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, bless weapon	COST:4,400 gp	WT:1	
Standard of Courage		SOURCEPAGE:p.136	TYPE:Equip.Standard.Magic	SPROP:For a standard of courage to be effective, it must be affixed to a two-handed hafted weapon such as a halberd or a lance. The bearer of the standard and any allies within 30 feet of the item gain a +4 morale bonus against fear effects. Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, remove fear	COST:15000	WT:1	
Standard of Heroism		SOURCEPAGE:p.136	TYPE:Equip.Standard.Magic	SPROP:This standard functions as a standard of courage, except that the standard bearer and any allies within 30 feet of the item gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks. Faint enchantment and abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, heroism, remove fear	COST:40000	WT:1	
Standard of No Retreat		SOURCEPAGE:p.136	TYPE:Equip.Standard.Magic	SPROP:This standard functions as a standard of courage, except that it also prevents outward extradimensional travel within 30 feet, just as if creatures were subjected to a dimensional anchor spell. Creatures trying to flee from the standard's area must succeed on a DC 19 Will save, or their attempt to flee fails. A standard of no retreat doesn't prevent creatures from using extradimensional travel to enter the area, just to leave it. Summoned creatures within the standard's area still disappear when the spell that brought them here ends. Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, dimensional anchor, remove fear	COST:145000	WT:1	

###Block: Exotic Weapons
Buckler-Axe, Dwarven	KEY:Buckler Axe (Dwarven)	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Buckler Axe (Dwarven)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Slashing.Light.Dwarven.Axe	COST:20	WT:4	WIELD:Light		SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d6	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x3	EQMOD:STEEL												SPROP:Penalty when wielded			SPROP:At first glance the dwarven buckler-axe appears similar to a standard buckler, but this weapon has enlarged bladelike edges at its top and bottom, allowing the wielder to swing it like an axe. Thus, in addition to its obvious protective qualities, it proves a capable off-hand weapon or emergency weapon when disarmed. A dwarven buckler-axe grants its wielder a +1 shield bonus to Armor Class. As with any shield, when you attack with a dwarven buckler-axe, you do not get the shield bonus to your AC. The buckler-axe also provides a -1 armor check penalty and incurs a 5%% arcane spell failure chance for its wielder. Like a spiked shield, a buckler-axe can be enhanced as a weapon, as a shield, or both, but such enhancements must be paid for and applied separately.
Lightblade, Elven		KEY:Lightblade (Elven)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Lightblade (Elven)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Piercing.Light.Elven.Sword	COST:50	WT:1	WIELD:Light		SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d6	CRITRANGE:3	CRITMULT:x2	EQMOD:STEEL															SOURCEPAGE:p.157	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:This rapierlike weapon is the size of a short sword, but weighs only as much as a dagger. Dexterous elf fighters and rogues favor it. Its thin, flexible blade slips easily into the seams of armor or between the ribs of a foe. Some elf nobles carry a lightblade-often decorated with intricate filigree and tiny gemstones-as a sign of their station, even if they aren't proficient in its use.
Tortoise Blade, Gnome	KEY:Tortoise Blade (Gnome)	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Tortoise Blade (Gnome)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Piercing.Light.Gnomish.Dagger	COST:10	WT:3	WIELD:Light		SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d6	CRITRANGE:2	CRITMULT:x2	EQMOD:STEEL															SOURCEPAGE:p.158	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:This contraption is designed to be used by a gnome in his or her off hand. It is particularly useful in cramped tunnels or warrens where swinging a weapon is difficult or impossible. It looks like a turtle shell strapped to the wielder's wrist, with a daggerlike blade jutting out where the wielder's fingers should be. A tortoise blade grants a +1 shield bonus to Armor Class. As with any shield, when you attack with a tortoise blade you do not get the shield bonus to your AC. A tortoise blade also provides a -1 armor check penalty and incurs a 5%% arcane spell failure chance for its wielder. Like a spiked shield, a tortoise blade can be enhanced as a weapon, as a shield, or both, but such enhancements must be paid for and applied separately.
Maul									PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Maul				TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Martial.Melee.Standard.Bludgeoning.TwoHanded.Mace	COST:15	WT:20	WIELD:TwoHanded		SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d10	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x3	EQMOD:STEEL													BONUS:WEAPON|WIELDCATEGORY|-1|PREFEAT:1,Exotic Weapon Proficiency(Maul)		SOURCEPAGE:p.157	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:A maul is too large to use in one hand without special training (the appropriate Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat). A character can use a maul two-handed as a martial weapon.
Pick, Dire			KEY:Pick (Dire)			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Pick (Dire)		TYPE:Weapon.Martial.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Piercing.TwoHanded.Pick	COST:30	WT:12	WIELD:TwoHanded		SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d8	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x4	EQMOD:STEEL													BONUS:WEAPON|WIELDCATEGORY|-1|PREFEAT:1,Exotic Weapon Proficiency(Pick (Dire))		SOURCEPAGE:p.157	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:A dire pick resembles a heavy pick, but with a longer shaft and a more massive head. A dire pick is too large to use in one hand without special training (the appropriate Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat). A character can use a dire pick two-handed as a martial weapon.
Scourge								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Scourge			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Slashing.OneHanded.Whip	COST:20	WT:2	WIELD:OneHanded		SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d8	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x2	EQMOD:STEEL												SPROP:+2 bonus on opposed attack roll when disarming an opponent			SOURCEPAGE:p.158	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:This multitailed, barbed whip is often dipped in a poison delivered via injury. You get a +2 bonus on your opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed if the attack fails) with this weapon.
Thinblade, Elven		KEY:Thinblade (Elven)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Thinblade (Elven)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Piercing.OneHanded.Elven.Sword	COST:100	WT:3	WIELD:OneHanded		SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d8	CRITRANGE:3	CRITMULT:x2	EQMOD:STEEL															SOURCEPAGE:p.158	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:This rapierlike weapon is the size of a longsword, but much lighter. Dexterous elf fighters and rogues favor it. Its thin, flexible blade slips easily into the seams of armor, or between the ribs of an enemy. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an elven thinblade.
Warmace								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Warmace			TYPE:Weapon.Martial.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Bludgeoning.TwoHanded.Mace	COST:25	WT:10	WIELD:TwoHanded		SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d12	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x2	EQMOD:STEEL													BONUS:WEAPON|WIELDCATEGORY|-1|PREFEAT:1,Exotic Weapon Proficiency(Warmace)	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|-1|PREEQUIPPRIMARY:1,Warmace	SOURCEPAGE:p.158	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:Anyone wielding a warmace takes a -1 penalty to Armor Class because the weight of the weapon makes it difficult to recover quickly from swinging it. A warmace is too large to use in one hand without special training (the appropriate Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat). A character can use a warmace two-handed as a martial weapon.
Greatspear								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Greatspear			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Ranged.Standard.Piercing.TwoHanded.Reach.Spear	COST:25	WT:9	WIELD:TwoHanded		SIZE:M	DAMAGE:2d6	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x3	EQMOD:WOOD						RANGE:10		REACHMULT:2							SOURCEPAGE:p.156	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:This broad-bladed spear has a long, flat blade, and is too heavy to wield properly without proficiency.
Hammer, Double		KEY:Hammer (Double)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Hammer (Double)		TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Double.Standard.Bludgeoning.Hammer	COST:70	WT:18	WIELD:TwoHanded	SLOTS:2	SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d8	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x3	EQMOD:STEEL	ALTTYPE:Melee.Exotic.Bludgeoning.Hammer	ALTDAMAGE:1d8	ALTCRITRANGE:1	ALTCRITMULT:x3	ALTEQMOD:STEEL										SOURCEPAGE:p.156	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:A double hammer is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons as if you were attacking with a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. (See page 160 of the Player's Handbook for details on fighting with two weapons.)
Lajatang								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Lajatang			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Slashing.TwoHanded.Double.Quarterstaff	COST:90	WT:7	WIELD:TwoHanded	SLOTS:2	SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d8	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x2	EQMOD:WOOD	ALTTYPE:Melee.Exotic.Slashing.Quarterstaff	ALTDAMAGE:1d8	ALTCRITRANGE:1	ALTCRITMULT:x2	ALTEQMOD:WOOD										SOURCEPAGE:p.157	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:The lajatang is a staff with a crescent-shaped blade at each end. A lajatang is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons: a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see page 160 of the Player's Handbook). A monk who is proficient with the lajatang can treat it as a special monk weapon, as described in the monk class description (page 40 of the Player's Handbook). Each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of the flurry of blows ability, similar to how the quarterstaff works.
Mancatcher								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Mancatcher			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Bludgeoning.TwoHanded.Double.Reach	COST:20	WT:8	WIELD:TwoHanded		SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d4	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x2	EQMOD:STEEL								REACHMULT:2							SOURCEPAGE:p.157	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:City guards and others who prefer to capture their opponents unharmed use the mancatcher. A wielder who hits a target of its size or one size category smaller than it with a mancatcher can immediately attempt to grapple (as a free action) without provoking an attack of opportunity. Any grapple check you make using a mancatcher includes the mancatcher's enhancement bonus (if any) and any other bonuses you might have on attack rolls with the weapon (such as from the Weapon Focus feat). If you grapple a target with a mancatcher, you are considered grappling, but unless your target can reach you, he can't attempt to attack you, damage you, or pin you. You can escape the grapple automatically by releasing the target as a standard action. In addition to the normal options available to a grappler, the wielder of a mancatcher can attempt to force his target to the ground (the equivalent of a trip attack, though no attack roll is necessary). The mancatcher is a reach weapon and cannot be used against adjacent opponents.
Poleaxe, Heavy		KEY:Poleaxe (Heavy)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Poleaxe (Heavy)		TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Piercing.Slashing.TwoHanded.Reach.Polearm	COST:20	WT:15	WIELD:TwoHanded		SIZE:M	DAMAGE:2d6	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x3	EQMOD:STEEL								REACHMULT:2							SOURCEPAGE:p.157	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:A heavy poleaxe has reach; you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe. Normally, you strike with the heavy poleaxe's axe head, but the spike on the end is useful against charging opponents. If you use a ready action to set a heavy poleaxe against a charge, you deal double damage if you score a hit against a charging creature.

Dart, Blowgun (10)	KEY:Dart (Blowgun/10)			TYPE:Ammunition.Standard.Dart	COST:10	WT:5							EQMOD:STEEL.WOOD						SOURCEPAGE:G					BASEQTY:10			SOURCEPAGE:p.156	SPROP:A blowgun dart resembles a lightweight, undersized arrow. You don't apply your Strength modifier to damage with a blowgun dart. A blowgun dart can't effectively be used as a melee weapon. Blowgun darts come in a leather pouch that holds 10 darts. A dart that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50%% chance to be destroyed or lost.
Dart, Blowgun		KEY:Dart (Blowgun)			TYPE:Ammunition.Standard.Dart	COST:1	WT:0.5							EQMOD:STEEL.WOOD						SOURCEPAGE:G									SOURCEPAGE:p.156	SPROP:A blowgun dart resembles a lightweight, undersized arrow. You don't apply your Strength modifier to damage with a blowgun dart. A blowgun dart can't effectively be used as a melee weapon. Blowgun darts come in a leather pouch that holds 10 darts. A dart that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50%% chance to be destroyed or lost.


Blowgun, Greater		KEY:Blowgun (Greater)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Blowgun (Greater)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Standard.Piercing.TwoHanded.Container.Projectile.Blowgun	COST:15	WT:2		WIELD:TwoHanded														CONTAINS:UNLIM|Dart=1					SOURCEPAGE:p.155	SPROP:Like its smaller cousin (see page 145 of the Dungeon Master's Guide), the greater blowgun is often used to deliver poison. The darts it fires are larger than blowgun needles, but smaller than a thrown dart. These darts deal damage in addition to delivering poison. A greater blowgun requires two hands to use or reload. Loading a blowgun is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A greater blowgun has a maximum range of five range increments.
Bolas, Barbed		KEY:Bolas (Barbed)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Bolas	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Bludgeoning.Standard.Thrown.Bolas	COST:10	WT:3			SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d4	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x2	EQMOD:WOOD						RANGE:10								SOURCEPAGE:p.155	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:This weapon is similar to a normal set of bolas, except that its weighted balls are studded with hooked barbs and thus deal lethal (not nonlethal) damage. Because the barbed bolas can wrap around an enemy's leg or other limb, you can use this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a set of barbed bolas. For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, barbed bolas are treated as if they were bolas. Thus, if you have Exotic Weapon Proficiency (bolas), you are also profi- cient with barbed bolas.
Boomerang								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Boomerang	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Standard.Bludgeoning.OneHanded.Thrown.Boomerang	COST:10	WT:2		WIELD:OneHanded	SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d4	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x2	EQMOD:WOOD						RANGE:20								SOURCEPAGE:p.155	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:The boomerang is a curved throwing stick that returns to its thrower if it misses its target. To catch a returning boomerang, the thrower must make an attack roll (as if he were throwing the boomerang) and hit AC 10. Failure indicates the boomerang lands in a randomly determined square adjacent to the thrower (if the thrower is proficient) or 1d4 squares away in a random direction (if not proficient).
Greatbow								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Greatbow	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Standard.Piercing.TwoHanded.Container.Projectile.Bow.Greatbow	COST:150	WT:6	WIELD:TwoHanded	SLOTS:2	SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d10	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x3	EQMOD:WOOD						RANGE:120			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Arrow=1				BONUS:WEAPON|DAMAGE|min(STR,0)	SOURCEPAGE:p.156	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. A greatbow sized for a Medium character is 6 feet or more in length when strung. A greatbow is too un wieldy to use while mounted. Like other bows, if you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when using a greatbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite greatbow (see below) but not a regular greatbow.
Greatbow, Composite	KEY:Greatbow (Composite)	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Greatbow	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Standard.Piercing.TwoHanded.Container.Projectile.Bow.Greatbow.Composite	COST:200	WT:6	WIELD:TwoHanded	SLOTS:2	SIZE:M	DAMAGE:1d10	CRITRANGE:1	CRITMULT:x3	EQMOD:WOOD						RANGE:130			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Arrow=1		MODS:REQUIRED		BONUS:WEAPON|DAMAGE|min(STR,0)	SOURCEPAGE:p.156	TYPE:Equip	SPROP:You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. A composite greatbow is too unwieldy to use while mounted. A composite greatbow sized for a Medium character is 6 feet or more in length when strung. Composite greatbows follow all of the normal rules for composite bows, including strength ratings. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 200 gp to the cost.
