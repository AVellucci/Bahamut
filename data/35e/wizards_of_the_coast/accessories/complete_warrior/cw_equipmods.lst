# Armor Special Abilities	139
Anti-Impact	SPROP:Armor with the anti-impact quality is designed to cushion the blow from massive blunt traumas. Anti-impact armor doesn't give extra protection against weapon damage (beyond its AC bonus), but bludgeoning damage that affects all or most of the entire body (such as constriction and falling damage) is halved. Faint Abjuration; CL 4th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, feather fall; Price +2,000 gp.
Axeblock	SPROP:This armor is magically enhanced to turn away slashing weapons such as axes and most swords. The wearer gains damage reduction 5/bludgeoning or piercing. If a single shield or suit of armor has two of the three blocking armor qualities (axeblock, hammerblock, and spearblock), it grants its owner just 5 points of damage reduction by whatever damage type appears twice. For example, a +1 chain shirt with the axeblock (DR 5/bludgeoning or piercing) and hammerblock (DR 5/piercing or slashing) special abilities only provides DR 5/piercing. Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, polymorph any object; Price +2 bonus.

Hammerblock	SPROP:Armor with this quality functions the same as axeblock armor, except that it provides damage reduction of 5/piercing or slashing. Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, polymorph any object; Price +2 bonus.
Spearblock	SPROP:Armor with this quality functions the same as axeblock armor, except that it provides damage reduction of 5/bludgeoning or slashing. Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, polymorph any object; Price +2 bonus.

###Block: Weapon Special Abilities
Blood Seeking	SPROP:Weapons with the blood seeking ability often have strange-looking sights on them. Ammunition fi red from blood seeking weapons fl ies around cover if necessary to strike a living creature, negating any bonus to Armor Class the target might have due to intervening cover. The shooter can even fi re at a target with full cover, but she must know the target is there, there must be an unobstructed path for the ammunition to reach the target, and the target still has total concealment (and thus a 50% miss chance). The blood seeking ability doesn't function against plants, oozes, undead, and constructs. Moderate divination; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, arcane eye; Price +1 bonus.
Defl ecting	SPROP:If you're wielding a defl ecting weapon of your size or one size larger, you can try to knock projectiles aimed at you out of the air. Once per round when you would normally be hit by a ranged weapon, you may make a DC 20 Refl ex saving throw (if the ranged weapon has a magical enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount). If you succeed, the ranged weapon or projectile defl ects away harmlessly. You must be aware of the attack and not fl atfooted. Only melee weapons can have this ability. Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, entropic shield; Price +1 bonus.
Disarming	SPROP:This weapon ability functions differently depending on whether it's applied to a melee weapon or a ranged weapon. If applied to a melee weapon, the disarming ability eliminates the opponent's bonuses for both weapon size and two-handed weapons. If applied to a ranged weapon, the disarming ability makes possible a disarm attack; you can shoot a weapon out of someone's hand. The relative weapon sizes don't matter for a ranged disarm attempt, but the defender gains a +4 bonus for wielding a weapon in two hands. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, telekinesis; Price +2 bonus.
Exit Wound	SPROP:Weapons with the exit wound ability propel their ammunition entirely through living targets they hit. This effect deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. The weapon or projectile continues in a straight line beyond the original target. Targets in that path are attacked using the same attack roll as the original target; these additional targets gain a +4 bonus to AC for each previous target in the path. When an exit wound weapon or projectile hits an object, it stops. The exit wound ability can be applied to any ranged weapon; projectile weapons so enhanced bestow the ability on their ammunition. Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Melf's acid arrow; Price +2 bonus.
Explosive	SPROP:Always slightly warm to the touch, weapons with the explosive ability deal extra damage to anyone near the intended target. Each successful hit with an explosive weapon deals 2d4 points of damage to all targets in a 5-foot burst (Refl ex DC 15 half), including the original target. The explosive ability can be applied to any melee weapon (though the wielder may be subject to the extra damage) or ranged weapon. Projectile weapons so enhanced bestow the explosive ability on their ammunition. Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shatter; Price +2 bonus (+3 bonus for ranged weapons).

135
Knockback	SPROP:Knockback weapons often emit a low, almost inaudible hum when drawn. Whenever a knockback weapon hits its target, it initiates a bull rush attack in addition to dealing normal damage. To resolve the bull rush attempt, treat the projectile as a Medium creature with a +8 Strength bonus. The projectile doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity, and it always tries to push the target as far back as possible. Only ranged weapons can have the knockback ability, and they bestow it on their ammunition. Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Bigby's forceful hand; Price +3 bonus.
Last Resort	SPROP:A melee weapon (usually a dagger) with the last resort ability is particularly effective in a grapple. Its wielder doesn't take the -4 penalty for attacking with a weapon while grappling, and the weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage in a grapple for every size category the target is bigger than the wielder. For example, a halfl ing armed with a +1 last resort dagger would deal an extra 2d6 points of damage when being grappled by an ogre. Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, freedom of movement; Price +1 bonus.

# Special Materials	136
Pandemonic Silver	SPROP:Mined from thin veins of ore on the plane of Pandemonium, pandemonic silver has all the properties of alchemical silver (see page 284 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). In addition, a thin, unearthly scream issues forth from a bladed weapon made of pandemonic silver whenever it's unsheathed in at least a light breeze. This scream is a sonic, mind-affecting compulsion that is a fear effect. Other than the wielder, those within 30 feet who hear the scream must succeed on a Will save or cower for 1d4 rounds. The DC of the Will save depends on the strength of the wind, as indicated on the table below.

Wind Force Save DC
Light (0-10 mph) 10
Moderate (11-20 mph) 13
Strong (21-30 mph) 16
Severe (31-50 mph) 19
Windstorm (51-74 mph) 22
Hurricane (75-154 mph) 25
Tornado (175-300 mph) 28
Pandemonic silver can be used to coat the striking surface of any slashing or piercing weapon made of steel. The cost of the weapon increases as shown below.

Light slashing or piercing weapon +9,000 gp
One-handed slashing or piercing weapon, +11,000 gp

Susalian Chainweave	SPROP:Made by a technique known only to the greatest elven armorsmiths, susalian chainweave is an elaborate system of chainmail links knitted together to provide additional protection against some blows. When an attack with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon hits a character wearing susalian chainweave, the armor stiffens at the point of contact and disperses the force of the attack. This quality gives the wearer damage reduction 3/piercing as long as the susalian chainweave armor is worn. Type of Susalian Chainweave Item Item Cost Modifi er
Light armor +28,000 gp
Medium armor +35,000 gp
Heavy armor +42,000 gp

Thinaun	SPROP:This dark, glittering steel alloy holds an attraction to souls recently released from their bodies. Obviously, this has application for melee weapons. If a thinaun melee weapon is touching a creature when it dies, that creature's soul is sucked into the weapon rather than passing on to its fi nal reward. The soul remains in the thinaun weapon until the weapon is destroyed or another creature dies while touching the thinaun weapon (the new soul displaces the old one). Raise dead, resurrection, and similar spells won't bring back a creature whose soul is trapped by a thinaun weapon unless the caster has the weapon in his possession. Because the soul is nearby, fewer material components are required for such spells: Reincarnation, raise dead, resurrection, and true resurrection require half as much of the relevant material component (unguents or diamonds) to cast if the soul is within a thinaun weapon. A thinaun weapon captures a soul from anyone killed while touching the weapon. This means that if the thinaun weapon's wielder dies, her weapon captures her soul. Only melee weapons made primarily of metal can be crafted as thinaun weapons.
Type of Thinaun Item Item Cost Modifi er
Light weapon +10,000 gp
One-handed weapon, +15,000 gp
or one head of a double weapon
Two-handed weapon, +20,000 gp
or both heads of a double weapon
