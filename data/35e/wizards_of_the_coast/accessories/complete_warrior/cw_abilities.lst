# Hexblade
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Hexblade	SOURCEPAGE:p.6	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Hexblades are profi cient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor but not with shields. Because the somatic components required for hexblade spells are simple, a hexblade can cast hexblade spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a hexblade wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (and most do). A multiclass hexblade still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells derived from other classes.
Hexblade's Curse			KEY:Hexblade's Curse ~ Hexblade			SOURCEPAGE:p.6	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once per day, as a free action, a hexblade can unleash a curse upon a foe. The target must be visible to the hexblade and within 60 feet. The target of a hexblade's curse takes a -2 penalty on attacks, saves, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for 1 hour thereafter. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 hexblade's class level + hexblade's Cha modifier) negates the effect. At every four levels beyond 1st (5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th) a hexblade gains the ability to use his curse one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 1-1. Multiple hexblade's curses don't stack, and any foe that successfully resists the effect cannot be affected again by the same hexblade's curse for 24 hours. Any effect that removes or dispels a curse eliminates the effect of a hexblade's curse.	DEFINE:HexbladesCurseTimes|0	ASPECT:NAME|Hexblade's Curse %1/day|HexbladesCurseTimes
Arcane Resistance			KEY:Arcane Resistance ~ Hexblade			SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 2nd level, a hexblade gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum +1) on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.
Mettle				KEY:Mettle ~ Hexblade					SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, a hexblade can resist magical and unusual attacks with great willpower or fortitude. If he makes a successful Will or Fortitude save against an attack that normally would have a lesser effect on a successful save (such as any spell with a saving throw entry of Will half or Fortitude partial), he instead completely negates the effect. An unconscious or sleeping hexblade does not gain the benefi t of mettle.
Summon Familiar			KEY:Familiar ~ Hexblade					SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a hexblade can obtain a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant. The hexblade chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the hexblade advances in level, his familiar also increases in power. Treat the hexblade as a sorcerer of three levels lower for determining the familiar's powers and abilities (see the Familiars sidebar on page 52 of the Player's Handbook). If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the hexblade, the latter must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per hexblade level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a hexblade's experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, but it does not lose a level or a point of Constitution when this happy event occurs. A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Familiar
Spells				KEY:Spells ~ Hexblade					SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a hexblade gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells, which are drawn from the hexblade spell list (see Chapter 3). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, just as a sorcerer can (see page 54 of the Player's Handbook). To learn or cast a spell, a hexblade must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, Cha 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Diffi - culty Class for a saving throw against a hexblade's spell is 10 + the spell level + the hexblade's Cha modifi er. Like other spellcasters, a hexblade can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-1. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifi ers and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the Player's Handbook). When Table 1-1 indicates that the hexblade gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 4th-level hexblade), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. The hexblade's selection of spells is extremely limited. A hexblade begins play knowing no spells, but gains one or more new spells at certain levels, as indicated on Table 1-2. (Unlike spells per day, his Charisma score does not affect the number of spells a hexblade knows; the numbers on Table 1-2 are fi xed.) Upon reaching 12th level, and at every third hexblade level after that (15th and 18th), a hexblade can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the hexblade "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level hexblade spell the hexblade can cast. For instance, upon reaching 12th level, a hexblade could trade in a single 1stlevel spell (two spell levels below the highest-level hexblade spell he can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1st-level spell. At 15th level, he could trade in a single 1st-level or 2nd-level spell (since he now can cast 4th-level hexblade spells) for a different spell of the same level. A hexblade may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. Through 3rd level, a hexblade has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his hexblade level.
Bonus Feat				KEY:Bonus Feat ~ Hexblade				SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th), a hexblade gains a bonus feat, which must be selected from the following list: Combat Casting, Greater Spell Focus (enchantment, necromancy, or transmutation only), Greater Spell Penetration, Spell Focus (enchantment, necromancy, or transmutation only), Spell Penetration.

Greater Hexblade's Curse	KEY:Greater Hexblade's Curse ~ Hexblade		SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When a hexblade attains 7th level, the penalty on attacks, saves, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls incurred by a target of the hexblade's curse becomes -4 instead of -2.
Aura of Unluck			KEY:Aura of Unluck ~ Hexblade				SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once per day, a hexblade of 12th level or higher can create a baleful aura of misfortune. Any melee or ranged attack made against the hexblade while this aura of unluck is active has a 20%% miss chance (similar to the effect of concealment). Activating the aura is a free action, and the aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the hexblade's Charisma bonus (if any). At 16th level and higher, a hexblade can use his aura of unluck twice per day. A 20th-level hexblade can activate this aura three times per day.

Dire Hexblade's Curse		KEY:Dire Hexblade's Curse ~ Hexblade		SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When a hexblade attains 19th level, the penalty on attacks, saves, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls incurred by a target of the hexblade's curse becomes -6 instead of -4.
