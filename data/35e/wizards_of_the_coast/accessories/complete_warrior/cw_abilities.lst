# Hexblade
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Hexblade	SOURCEPAGE:p.6	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Hexblades are profi cient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor but not with shields. Because the somatic components required for hexblade spells are simple, a hexblade can cast hexblade spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a hexblade wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (and most do). A multiclass hexblade still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells derived from other classes.
Hexblade's Curse			KEY:Hexblade's Curse ~ Hexblade			SOURCEPAGE:p.6	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once per day, as a free action, a hexblade can unleash a curse upon a foe. The target must be visible to the hexblade and within 60 feet. The target of a hexblade's curse takes a -2 penalty on attacks, saves, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for 1 hour thereafter. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 hexblade's class level + hexblade's Cha modifier) negates the effect. At every four levels beyond 1st (5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th) a hexblade gains the ability to use his curse one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 1-1. Multiple hexblade's curses don't stack, and any foe that successfully resists the effect cannot be affected again by the same hexblade's curse for 24 hours. Any effect that removes or dispels a curse eliminates the effect of a hexblade's curse.	DEFINE:HexbladesCurseTimes|0	ASPECT:NAME|Hexblade's Curse %1/day|HexbladesCurseTimes
Arcane Resistance			KEY:Arcane Resistance ~ Hexblade			SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 2nd level, a hexblade gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum +1) on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.
Mettle				KEY:Mettle ~ Hexblade					SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, a hexblade can resist magical and unusual attacks with great willpower or fortitude. If he makes a successful Will or Fortitude save against an attack that normally would have a lesser effect on a successful save (such as any spell with a saving throw entry of Will half or Fortitude partial), he instead completely negates the effect. An unconscious or sleeping hexblade does not gain the benefi t of mettle.
Summon Familiar			KEY:Familiar ~ Hexblade					SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a hexblade can obtain a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant. The hexblade chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the hexblade advances in level, his familiar also increases in power. Treat the hexblade as a sorcerer of three levels lower for determining the familiar's powers and abilities (see the Familiars sidebar on page 52 of the Player's Handbook). If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the hexblade, the latter must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per hexblade level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a hexblade's experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, but it does not lose a level or a point of Constitution when this happy event occurs. A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Familiar
Spells				KEY:Spells ~ Hexblade					SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a hexblade gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells, which are drawn from the hexblade spell list (see Chapter 3). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, just as a sorcerer can (see page 54 of the Player's Handbook). To learn or cast a spell, a hexblade must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, Cha 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Diffi - culty Class for a saving throw against a hexblade's spell is 10 + the spell level + the hexblade's Cha modifi er. Like other spellcasters, a hexblade can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-1. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifi ers and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the Player's Handbook). When Table 1-1 indicates that the hexblade gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 4th-level hexblade), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. The hexblade's selection of spells is extremely limited. A hexblade begins play knowing no spells, but gains one or more new spells at certain levels, as indicated on Table 1-2. (Unlike spells per day, his Charisma score does not affect the number of spells a hexblade knows; the numbers on Table 1-2 are fi xed.) Upon reaching 12th level, and at every third hexblade level after that (15th and 18th), a hexblade can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the hexblade "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level hexblade spell the hexblade can cast. For instance, upon reaching 12th level, a hexblade could trade in a single 1stlevel spell (two spell levels below the highest-level hexblade spell he can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1st-level spell. At 15th level, he could trade in a single 1st-level or 2nd-level spell (since he now can cast 4th-level hexblade spells) for a different spell of the same level. A hexblade may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. Through 3rd level, a hexblade has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his hexblade level.
Bonus Feat				KEY:Bonus Feat ~ Hexblade				SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th), a hexblade gains a bonus feat, which must be selected from the following list: Combat Casting, Greater Spell Focus (enchantment, necromancy, or transmutation only), Greater Spell Penetration, Spell Focus (enchantment, necromancy, or transmutation only), Spell Penetration.

Greater Hexblade's Curse	KEY:Greater Hexblade's Curse ~ Hexblade		SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When a hexblade attains 7th level, the penalty on attacks, saves, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls incurred by a target of the hexblade's curse becomes -4 instead of -2.
Aura of Unluck			KEY:Aura of Unluck ~ Hexblade				SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once per day, a hexblade of 12th level or higher can create a baleful aura of misfortune. Any melee or ranged attack made against the hexblade while this aura of unluck is active has a 20%% miss chance (similar to the effect of concealment). Activating the aura is a free action, and the aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the hexblade's Charisma bonus (if any). At 16th level and higher, a hexblade can use his aura of unluck twice per day. A 20th-level hexblade can activate this aura three times per day.

Dire Hexblade's Curse		KEY:Dire Hexblade's Curse ~ Hexblade		SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.HexbladeClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When a hexblade attains 19th level, the penalty on attacks, saves, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls incurred by a target of the hexblade's curse becomes -6 instead of -4.

# Samurai
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Samurai	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SamuraiClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A samurai is profi cient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all types of armor, but not with shields.
Daisho Proficiency		KEY:Daisho Proficiency ~ Samurai			SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SamuraiClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:In melee combat, a samurai favors the katana (a masterwork bastard sword) and the wakizashi (a masterwork short sword). Many samurai receive an heirloom set of these two blades, known as the daisho. Because a samurai is trained in their use, he gains Exotic Weapon Profi ciency (bastard sword) as a bonus feat.
Two Swords as One			KEY:Two Swords as One ~ Samurai			SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SamuraiClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level, a samurai has learned to wield the katana and wakizashi together. He is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when wielding a katana and wakizashi, even if he does not meet the prerequisites for that feat.
Kiai Smite				KEY:Kiai Smite ~ Samurai				SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SamuraiClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Once per day, a samurai of 3rd level or higher can give a great cry during combat that invigorates him. When a sam urai shouts (a free action), his next attack gains a bonus on the attack roll and the damage roll equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum +1). As a samurai gains levels, he can make a kiai smite more often.
Iaijutsu Master			KEY:Iaijutsu Master ~ Samurai				SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SamuraiClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:By 5th level, a samurai has become adept at iaijutsu, a fi ghting technique that concentrates on drawing his weapon and striking a foe in one fluid motion. He is treated as having the Quick Draw feat, but only when he draws his katana or wakizashi.
Staredown				KEY:Staredown ~ Samurai					SOURCEPAGE:p.10	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SamuraiClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 6th level, a samurai becomes able to strike fear into his foes by his mere presence. He gains a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks and can demoralize an opponent (as described in the Intimidate skill description, page 76 of the Player's Handbook).
Improved Initiative		KEY:Improved Initiative ~ Samurai			SOURCEPAGE:p.10	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SamuraiClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 8th level, the samurai has practiced iaijutsu techniques used in ritual duels between two samurai, and he is able to anticipate when any enemy will attack.

Mass Staredown			KEY:Mass Staredown ~ Samurai				SOURCEPAGE:p.10	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SamuraiClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 10th level, a samurai has sufficient presence that he can cow multiple foes. Using a Intimidate check, the samurai can demoralize all opponents within 30 feet with a single standard action.
Improved Two Swords as One	KEY:Improved Two Swords as One ~ Samurai		SOURCEPAGE:p.10	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SamuraiClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 11th level, a samurai's prowess with the katana and wakizashi improves. He is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when wielding a katana and wakizashi, even if he does not meet the prerequisites for the feat.
Improved Staredown		KEY:Improved Staredown ~ Samurai			SOURCEPAGE:p.10	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SamuraiClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 14th level, even a glance from the hard eyes of a samurai is enough to give his foes pause. The samurai can demoralize opponents within 30 feet as a move action, not a standard action.
Greater Two Swords as One	KEY:Greater Two Swords as One ~ Samurai		SOURCEPAGE:p.10	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SamuraiClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 16th level, fi ghting with a katana and wakizashi becomes second nature for a samurai. He is treated as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when wielding a katana and wakizashi, even if he does not meet the prerequisites for that feat.
Frightful Presence		KEY:Frightful Presence ~ Samurai			SOURCEPAGE:p.10	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SamuraiClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A 20th-level samurai's bravery, honor, and fi ghting prowess have become legendary. When the samurai draws his blade, opponents within 30 feet must succeed on a Will save (DC 20 + samurai's Cha modifi er) or become panicked for 4d6 rounds (if they have 4 or fewer Hit Dice) or shaken for 4d6 rounds (if they have from 5 to 19 Hit Dice). Creatures with 20 or more Hit Dice are not affected. Any foe that successfully resists the effect cannot be affected again by the same samurai's frightful presence for 24 hours.

# Swashbuckler
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Swashbuckler	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SwashbucklerClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Swashbucklers are profi cient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor.

She applies her Intelligence bonus (if any) as a bonus on damage rolls (in addition to any Strength bonus she may have) with any light weapon, as well as any other weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse, such as a rapier, whip, or spiked chain. Targets immune to sneak attacks or critical hits are immune to the swashbuckler's insightful strike. A swashbuckler cannot use this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.
Dodge 				KEY:Dodge Bonus ~ Swashbuckler				SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SwashbucklerClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A swashbuckler is trained at focusing her defenses on a single opponent in melee. During her action, she may designate an opponent and receive a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class against melee attacks from that opponent. She can select a new opponent on any action. This bonus increases by +1 at every fi ve levels after 5th (+2 at 10th level, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th). A swashbuckler loses this bonus when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. If the swashbuckler also has the Dodge feat, she need not designate the same target for this ability as for the Dodge feat. (If she designates the same target, the bonuses stack.)
Acrobatic Charge			KEY:Acrobatic Charge ~ Swashbuckler			SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SwashbucklerClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A swashbuckler of 7th level or higher can charge in situations where others cannot. She may charge over diffi cult terrain that normally slows movement or allies blocking her path. This ability enables her to run down steep stairs, leap down from a balcony, or to tumble over tables to get to her target. Depending on the circumstance, she may still need to make appropriate checks (Jump or Tumble checks, in particular) to successfully move over the terrain.
Improved Flanking			KEY:Improved Flanking ~ Swashbuckler		SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SwashbucklerClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A swashbuckler of 8th level or higher who is fl anking an opponent gains a +4 bonus on attacks instead of a +2 bonus on attacks. (Other characters flanking with the swashbuckler don't gain this increased bonus.)
Lucky					KEY:Lucky ~ Swashbuckler				SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SwashbucklerClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Many swashbucklers live by the credo "Better lucky than good." Once per day, a swashbuckler of 11th level or higher may reroll any failed attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw. The character must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll.
Acrobatic Skill Mastery		KEY:Acrobatic Skill Mastery ~ Swashbuckler	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SwashbucklerClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 13th level, a swashbuckler becomes so certain in the use of her acrobatic skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.

Weakening Critical		KEY:Weakening Critical ~ Swashbuckler		SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SwashbucklerClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A swashbuckler of 14th level or higher who scores a critical hit against a creature also deals 2 points of Strength damage to the creature. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this effect.
Slippery Mind			KEY:Slippery Mind ~ Swashbuckler			SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SwashbucklerClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:When a swashbuckler reaches 17th level, her mind becomes more diffi cult to control. If the swashbuckler fails her save against an enchantment spell or effect, she can attempt the save again 1 round later at the same DC (assuming she is still alive). She gets only this one extra chance to succeed at a certain saving throw.
Wounding Critical			KEY:Wounding Critical ~ Swashbuckler		SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SwashbucklerClassFeature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A swashbuckler of 19th level or higher who scores a critical hit against a creature also deals 2 points of Constitution damage to the creature.
