Power Points/Day				KEY:Power Points/Day ~ Erudite			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.EruditeClassFeature.SpecialQuality							DESC:An erudite's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table 6-6. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table 2-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points, EPH 18). His race might also provide bonus power points per day, as might certain feats and items.																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.153
Unique Powers per Day			KEY:Unique Powers per Day ~ Erudite			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.EruditeClassFeature.SpecialQuality							DESC:An erudite manifests psionic powers, paying for each manifestation with an expenditure of power points. Unlike a psion, an erudite is limited to manifesting a certain number of unique psionic powers of each level per day from, the repertoire of powers he knows, according to his class level. Thus, a 1st-level erudite can manifest one unique power per day; however, the total number of powers he can manifest per day is limited only by his daily power points (that is, the erudite could manifest the unique power as many times per day as he has power points to pay for it). An erudite simply knows his powers; they are part of his repertoire. He does not need to prepare them, though he must get a good night's sleep to regain all spent power points the next day. An erudite does not choose a primary discipline.																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.153
Powers Discovered (Repertoire)	KEY:Powers Discovered (Repertoire) ~ Erudite	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.EruditeClassFeature.SpecialQuality							DESC:An erudite selects powers from the same power list that psions and wilders use. An erudite begins play knowing two 1st-level powers of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus your character possesses, he knows one additional 1st-level power when you begin play. Each time he achieves a new level, he unlocks the knowledge of two new powers of any level or levels that he can manifest (according to his new level) from the psion/wilder power list. An erudite cannot automatically learn powers from any of the discipline power lists. However, he can learn such powers later, as described below under Learning Discipline Powers. To learn or manifest a power, an erudite must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the power's level. The Difficulty Class for saving throws against erudite powers is 10 + the powers level + the erudite's Int modifier. An erudite can later learn new powers from power stones, from the minds of other willing psionic characters, and from the minds of unwilling unconscious psionic characters (see Adding Powers to an Erudite's Repertoire, below).

Psicrystal					KEY:Psicrystal Affinity ~ Erudite			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.EruditeClassFeature.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 1st level, an erudite gains Psicrystal Affinity (EPH 49) as a bonus feat.

Bonus Feats					KEY:Bonus Feat ~ Erudite				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.EruditeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:EruditeBonusFeatCount|0	DESC:An erudite gains a bonus feat at 1st level, 5th level, 10th level, 15th level, and 20th level. This feat must be a psionic feat, a metapsionic feat, or a psionic item creation feat. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains every three levels (as shown on Table 3-2: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits, PH 22). An erudite is not limited to psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats when choosing these other feats.
