Each spell to be affected requires the investment of a number of essentia equal to the normal spell level adjustment required by the metamagic feat (minimum 1 point of essentia). The next time you cast that spell, the spell gains the effect of that metamagic feat without any change to its level (or casting time, if you cast spells spontaneously). You can apply the effect of this feat to as many spells as you can afford to invest with essentia. You can apply the effect of different metamagic feats to different spells, as long as you know all metamagic feats applied and you have sufficient essentia capacity to do so. For example, you could invest 1 point of essentia to enlarge a spell (as Enlarge Spell) and 2 points of essentia to empower a spell (as Empower Spell), as long as you had at least 3 points of essentia to invest, had an essentia capacity (see Table 2-1: Essentia Capacity) of 3 or greater, and knew both the Empower Spell and Enlarge Spell feats.
