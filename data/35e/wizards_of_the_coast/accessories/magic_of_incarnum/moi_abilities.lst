###Block: Class Features
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Totemist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:You are proficient with all simple weapons, with light armor, and with shields (except tower shields).
Meldshaping				KEY:Totemist ~ Meldshaping				SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A totemist's primary ability is shaping incarnum soulmelds, which are drawn from the totemist soulmeld list (page 58). You know and can shape any soulmeld from this list. Unlike the aligned forces of an incarnate's melds, your soulmelds channel the bestial spirits of nature. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a totemist soulmeld is 10 + number of points of essentia invested in the soulmeld + your Constitution modifier. Your meldshaper level is equal to your totemist level. A totemist can shape only a certain number of soulmelds per day. Your base daily allotment is given on Table 2-4: The Totemist. The maximum number of soulmelds that you can have shaped simultaneously is equal to your Constitution score minus 10 or the number of soulmelds on the table, whichever is lower. At 1st level, you can shape two soulmelds at a time (assuming you have a Constitution score of at least 12). As you advance in level, you can shape an increasing number of soulmelds. At 1st level, you also gain access to your personal pool of essentia, which can be invested into your soulmelds to increase their power. Your essentia pool's size is shown on Table 2-4: The Totemist. Your character level, as noted on Table 2-1: Essentia Capacity, determines the maximum quantity of essentia that you can invest in any single soulmeld. As a swift action, you can reallocate your essentia investments in your soulmelds every round (see Essentia, page 50). A totemist does not study or prepare soulmelds in advance, but must have a good night's rest and must meditate for 1 hour to shape his soulmelds for the day (see Shaping Soulmelds, page 49).
Chakra Binds			KEY:Totemist ~ Chakra Binds				SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you can bind your soulmelds to your chakras, granting you new powers based on the soulmeld and the chakra chosen. Binding a soulmeld to a chakra closes the body slot associated with that chakra (see Chakras, page 50), so that you cannot also benefit from a magic item worn on the body slot associated with that chakra. The number of chakra binds that you can have active at any one time depends on your level (see the Chakra Binds column on Table 2-4: The Totemist). At 2nd level, you can bind a soulmeld to your totem chakra (see below). Beginning at 5th level, you can bind soulmelds to your crown, feet, or hands chakras. At 9th level, you can bind soulmelds to your arms, brow, or shoulders chakras. At 14th level, you can bind soulmelds to your throat or waist chakras. At 17th level, you can bind a soulmeld to your heart chakra. You never gain the ability to bind a soulmeld to your soul chakra. For more information on chakra binds, see page 51.
Totem Chakra Bind			KEY:Totemist ~ Totem Chakra Bind			SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, you gain access to a unique chakra: the totem chakra. This chakra is not associated with any location on the body, but rather represents your connection to the wild soul energy of nature, embodied in the magical beasts of the world. When you bind a soulmeld to your totem chakra, you take on characteristics of the creature represented by the meld-usually involving a limited physical transformation. Since the totem chakra doesn't match a body location, binding a soulmeld to this chakra doesn't restrict your use of magic items that take up a body location. Any soulmeld bound to your totem chakra has an essentia capacity 1 higher than the normal capacity for your soulmelds. For example, a 2nd-level totemist can invest up to 2 points of essentia in any soulmeld bound to his totem chakra bind (rather than the normal limit of 1 points of essentia). At 15th level, the capacity of any soulmeld bound to your totem chakra increases by an additional point (meaning that a 15th-level totemist could invest up to 5 points of essentia in that soulmeld). At 6th level, the effective meldshaper level of a soulmeld you have bound to your totem chakra is equal to your actual meldshaper level +1. The primary effect of this benefit is to make that soulmeld harder to unshape. At 11th level, you gain the ability to bind a single soulmeld to your totem chakra and to another chakra at the same time. You gain the special benefits of both chakra binds.
Wild Empathy			KEY:Totemist ~ Wild Empathy				SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As the druid class ability; see page 35 of the Player's Handbook. You gain a +4 bonus on wild empathy checks made to infl uence the reactions of magical beasts of the same kind as the beast associated with the soulmeld bound to your totem chakra. Thus, if you have a basilisk mask bound to your totem chakra, you gain the bonus on checks made to infl uence basilisks.
Illiteracy				KEY:Totemist ~ Illiteracy				SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Like barbarians, totemists do not begin the game knowing how to read and write. You can spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages you are able to speak. If you gain a level in any other class (except barbarian), you automatically gain literacy. A barbarian who gains a totemist level remains illiterate. Any other character who gains a totemist level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.
Totem's Protection		KEY:Totemist ~ Totem's Protection			SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level, you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against the supernatural abilities of magical beasts.
Rebind Totem Soulmeld		KEY:Totemist ~ Rebind Totem Soulmeld		SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As your link to your totem chakra strengthens, you learn to shift the ties that bind your soulmelds. Starting at 8th level, once per day you can unbind a soulmeld from your totem chakra and bind a different meld to that chakra, as long as the new meld is one you already have shaped. This requires a full-round action and provokes attacks of opportunity. You can use this ability one additional time for every four levels gained above 8th (2/day at 12th level, 3/day at 16th, and 4/day at 20th).
Totem Embodiment			KEY:Totemist ~ Totem Embodiment			SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 20th level, you gain the ability to temporarily link your body and soul to your totem chakra. This greatly enhances the power of essentia invested in soulmelds bound to that chakra. For the duration of this ability, your normal essentia capacity of any soulmeld bound to your totem chakra is doubled. Every point of essentia invested in a soulmeld bound to your totem chakra counts as 2 points of essentia. Activating this ability is a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. It can be used once per day and lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Constitution bonus (minimum 1).

###Block: Soulmelds
ACROBAT BOOTS			KEY:Soulmeld ~ ACROBAT BOOTS				SOURCEPAGE:p.54	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraFeet	PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1	ASPECT:Descriptors|None	ASPECT:Chakra|Feet	ASPECT:Saving Throw|None	DESC:You form incarnum into a pair of light, supple boots that fi t over your feet and any other boots you might wear. Small ruffs of blue-white fur crown each boot. While you wear them, you feel light on your feet. It is diffi cult to resist the temptation to bounce on the balls of your feet when you're standing still. Channeling energy from the most agile and nimble of souls, you claim some measure of that agility for yourself. While wearing acrobat boots, you gain a +2 insight bonus on Balance, Escape Artist, Jump, and Tumble checks. (This soulmeld does not let you attempt Tumble checks untrained.) Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in the acrobat boots increases the bonus by 2. Chakra Bind (Feet) Your acrobat boots join fast to your feet and help to slow you whenever you fall. You can reduce falling damage by 1d6 points per point of essentia invested in the acrobat boots. For example, if you fall 30 feet while 2 points of essentia are invested, you would take only 1d6 points of damage (rather than 3d6 points).
ADAMANT PAULDRONS			KEY:Soulmeld ~ ADAMANT PAULDRONS			SOURCEPAGE:p.54	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraShoulders	PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1	ASPECT:Descriptors|None	ASPECT:Chakra|Shoulders	ASPECT:Saving Throw|None	DESC:You shape incarnum into blue crystalline plates of shoulder armor. They fl oat slightly above your shoulders, leaving room for clothing and other armor. In battle, these pauldrons seem to draw attacks toward them, steering blows away from your most vital areas. The use of adamant pauldrons carries a stigma in some incarnate circles because of the example of Murthien the Soul-Render. The infamous incarnate is said to have worn adamant pauldrons on which the tormented visages of imprisoned souls were clearly visible, wracked with pain from the necrocarnum energies Murthien wielded. Wise incarnates refuse to allow the corrupted practice of one notable individual to prevent them from employing a highly useful soulmeld, however. Your adamant pauldrons grant you protection from physical attacks. Whenever a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on you, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. Essentia: You gain damage reduction equal to the number of points of essentia invested in this soulmeld. This damage reduction is bypassed only by attacks of an alignment opposed to that of your incarnate cause (good, evil, chaos, or law). Thus, if you invest 3 points of essentia in your adamant pauldrons and you are a good incarnate, you gain damage reduction 3/evil. Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Your incarnate pauldrons settle over your shoulders, and they seem to be joined by a crystalline lattice of blue energy across your back. Their power to defl ect blows away from vital areas is increased. The chance that your adamant pauldrons negate a critical hit or sneak attack against you increases to 50%.
AIRSTEP SANDALS			KEY:Soulmeld ~ AIRSTEP SANDALS			SOURCEPAGE:p.55	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraFeet	PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1	ASPECT:Chakra|Feet	DESC:You shape incarnum into a pair of sky-blue sandals. They surround your feet without quite touching them, fi tting over any boots or shoes you wear. When you use the fl ight ability of the sandals, you leave a faint trail of blue vapor behind you, which disperses after a few seconds. Many creatures have the gift of fl ight, and with this soulmeld, you channel soul energy derived from such creatures to borrow that gift. The rilkan incarnate Davi the Trickster was rarely seen without this soulmeld shaped, and she claimed that she could communicate with the djinn whose soul energy she borrowed to form it. While worn, the airstep sandals allow you to fl y up to 10 feet (good maneuverability) as a move action once per round. You must end the fl ight solidly supported or you fall. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your airstep sandals increases the distance you can fl y by 10 feet. Chakra Bind (Feet) Your airstep sandals merge into your feet, turning your legs sky blue from your knees down to your toes. You become capable of aerial acrobatics, turning on a dime in midair with a soft burst of pale blue mist. You fl y with perfect maneuverability. In practical terms, this means that you can reverse direction without paying a movement cost, you can turn freely without spending any extra movement, and you can ascend at full speed.
ANKHEG BREASTPLATE		KEY:Soulmeld ~ ANKHEG BREASTPLATE			SOURCEPAGE:p.56	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraThroat.ChakraTotem	PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1	ASPECT:Descriptors|Acid	ASPECT:Chakra|Throat (totem)	ASPECT:Saving Throw|See text	DESC:A thick, chitinous breastplate forms around your torso. The green plates of the armor glisten like the thorax of a living insect. Soft tissue and living muscle bind the plates together, rather than the chain and leather of conventional armor. Ankhegs are burrowing predators protected by thick plates of chitin. The totemist tradition reveres them as protectors, but it also seeks to claim the destructive power of their mandibles and their acidic spittle. Your ankheg breastplate grants you a +2 armor bonus to your Armor Class. As always, this bonus does not stack with an armor bonus from a different source (such as actual armor you might be wearing). If you have another armor bonus, the higher bonus applies. This soulmeld has no maximum Dexterity bonus, armor check penalty, or arcane spell failure. It is treated as light armor for the purpose of determining your speed and adjudicating class features dependent on armor. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your ankheg breastplate, the armor bonus granted by the soulmeld improves by 1. Chakra Bind (Throat) Green chitin spreads from your breastplate up your neck, blending into your skin there. This thickened skin seems to pulse slowly, in a rhythm unrelated to the beat of your heart or the movement of your breath. You gain the ability to spit a line of acid as a standard action. Once per minute, you can emit a line of acid that is 5 feet long plus 5 feet per point of invested essentia. Targets in the line take 2d6 points of acid damage plus 1d6 points for every point of invested essentia. They can reduce this damage by half with a successful Refl ex save. Chakra Bind (Totem) Green-brown chitin spreads from your breastplate up your neck to your face, and you sprout serrated mandibles like those of a giant insect. Outside of combat, they slowly open and close without any conscious direction. In battle, you can use these terrible clenching jaws to tear the fl esh of your foes. When you shift essentia to this soulmeld, the mandibles sizzle with acid. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. You can use this bite either as a primary attack (in which case it uses your full base attack bonus and adds your Strength bonus on damage rolls) or as a secondary attack (with a -5 penalty on the attack roll and applying only half your Strength bonus on your damage roll). Every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld adds 1d4 points of acid damage to your bite damage.

BASILISK MASK			KEY:Soulmeld ~ BASILISK MASK				SOURCEPAGE:p.59	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow.ChakraTotem	PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1		ASPECT:Chakra|Brow (totem)	ASPECT:Saving Throw|See text	DESC:A hideous mask with red-brown scales forms around and over your face, actually floating about an inch in front of your nose. The visage is reptilian, with a protruding lower jaw and teeth jutting upward. Bony spines stick up from the top of the mask, completing the portrait of a basilisk. While the basilisk is feared primarily for its petrifying gaze, totemists also revere it as a patron of vision. Your basilisk mask grants you low-light vision. Essentia: The basilisk mask grants you darkvision with a range of 30 feet per point of essentia invested in the soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Brow) Your basilisk mask merges into your forehead, and your eyes are now clearly visible in the face of the basilisk. The visual effect is a little unsettling, but the improvement to your perception is dramatic. You gain the benefi t of the Blind-Fight feat. Chakra Bind (Totem) Behind the mask, your eyes glow with a pale green radiance that is clearly visible through the eyes of the basilisk. There is a sense of weight in your forehead, but it is not entirely unpleasant-more like a power anxious to be exercised. By directing your gaze on a creature within 30 feet who can see you, you can temporarily turn that creature to stone (as the flesh to stone spell, except that the duration is only 1 round). A successful Fortitude save negates this effect. Using this ability is a full-round action.
BEAST TAMER CIRCLET		KEY:Soulmeld ~ BEAST TAMER CIRCLET			SOURCEPAGE:p.60	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.Chakra	PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1	ASPECT:Chakra|Crown (totem)	DESC:You channel undifferentiated soul energy into a gleaming silver band that encircles your forehead at a distance of about an inch. If you concentrate, you can hear a very quiet murmur of growls, shrieks, and other animal noises-the cacophony of the beast world. Rather than channeling the specifi c soul energy of a particular kind of magical beast to emulate that beast, totemists sometimes prefer to use incarnum in a more general way to improve their interactions with all beasts. You gain a +2 insight bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your beast tamer circlet increases the insight bonus by 2. Chakra Bind (Crown) Your silver circlet fuses to your head, sending silver-blue tendrils like tiny veins under your skin. The endless clamor of beast noises becomes intelligible to you-you understand the range of needs and emotions that drives these utterances-but you are still able to ignore it with a modicum of concentration. You gain the ability to speak with animals, as the spell. You can also use this ability to communicate with magical beasts that have an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. You can use this ability in any round during which you invest essentia in your beast tamer circlet. Chakra Bind (Totem) Instead of a gleaming silver band around your head, your beast tamer circlet manifests as a ring of silver hair, while all the hair on your head becomes long and coarse like a beast's mane. You gain the ability to use animal trance, as the spell. You can use this ability once per minute, and it lasts as long as you maintain concentration and have any amount of essentia invested in your beast tamer circlet, to a maximum of 1 minute per meldshaper level.
BEHIR GORGET			KEY:Soulmeld ~ BEHIR GORGET				SOURCEPAGE:p.60	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.Chakra	PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1	ASPECT:Descriptors|Electricity	ASPECT:Chakra|Throat (totem)	ASPECT:Saving Throw|See text	DESC:Incarnum forms a large, deep blue collar around your neck, like part of a suit of plate armor. The color is darker on the back and fades to pale blue in the front, and bands of gray-brown line the top and bottom. The gorget tapers to a sharp point above your breastbone. Powerful beasts that resemble dragons, behirs are revered for their dangerous electrical breath weapon. Their dozen legs grant them stability, a quality totemists seek to appropriate through this soulmeld. Their hatred of dragons makes this a popular soulmeld for totemists planning to slay a dragon-particularly a blue or bronze dragon. Your behir gorget gives you a +4 bonus to resist being bull rushed or tripped. Essentia: If you invest essentia in your behir gorget, it protects you from electricity damage. You gain resistance to electricity equal to 5 times the number of points of essentia you invest in this soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Throat) Your armored collar merges into your throat, and your neck lengthens very slightly. You can feel a constant tingling in the sides of your neck, and tiny sparks occasionally spit from your mouth when you speak-particularly when you get excited or angry. You gain the ability to project a line of lightning similar to a behir's breath weapon. Once per minute, you can emit a line of lightning that is 5 feet long plus 5 feet per point of invested essentia. Targets in the line take 2d6 points of electricity damage plus 1d6 per point of invested essentia, and they can reduce this damage by half with a successful Refl ex save. Chakra Bind (Totem) As you bind your behir gorget to your totem chakra, its hard blue plating spreads up your neck to incorporate your entire head. Your face lengthens, and your jaw grows monstrous. Sharp teeth fi ll your mouth, allowing you to bite your foes savagely in combat. Sparks crackle in your mouth whenever you open it to bite-or even to speak. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. You can use this bite either as a primary attack (in which case it uses your full base attack bonus and adds your Strength bonus on damage rolls) or as a secondary attack (with a -5 penalty on the attack roll and applying only half your Strength bonus on your damage roll). Every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld adds 1d4 points of electricity damage to your bite damage.
BLINK SHIRT				KEY:Soulmeld ~ BLINK SHIRT				SOURCEPAGE:p.60	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.Chakra	PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1	ASPECT:Chakra|Heart (totem)	DESC:This rough-looking garment fi ts over armor and other clothing and looks like it has been made of coarse brown fur, but it displays obviously magical features. The shirt seems to shift and move on its own, and it fades into a barely corporeal mist near your waist. Most disconcerting of all, patches of the garment seem transparent, as if they have temporarily shifted to some strange elsewhere. Because different parts of the garment appear phased out at different times, these patches of incorporeality seem to roam over the surface of the shirt. Blink dogs have two closely related abilities that define their hunting tactics. Totemists emulate both their shortrange teleportation and the blinking that gives them
