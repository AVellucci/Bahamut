# Crusader

9
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: As a crusader, you are profi cient with simple weapons, martial weapons, light, medium, and heavy armor, and all shields.
Maneuvers: You begin your career with knowledge of five martial maneuvers. The disciplines available to you are Devoted Spirit, Stone Dragon, and White Raven. Once you know a maneuver, you must ready it before you can use it (see Maneuvers Readied, below). A maneuver usable by crusaders is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in its description. Your maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when you initiate one. You learn additional maneuvers at higher levels, as shown on Table 1-1. You must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it. See Table 3-1, page 39, to determine the highest-level maneuvers you can learn. Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered crusader level after that (6th, 8th, 10th, and so on), you can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one you already know. In effect, you lose the old maneuver in exchange for the new one. You can choose a new maneuver of any level you like, as long as you observe your restriction on the highest-level maneuvers you know; you need not replace the old maneuver with a maneuver of the same level. For example, upon reaching 10th level, you could trade in a single 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd- or 4th-level maneuver for a maneuver of 5th level or lower, as long as you meet the prerequisite of the new maneuver. You can swap only a single maneuver at any given level.
Maneuvers Readied: You can ready all five maneuvers you know at 1st level, but as you advance in level and learn more maneuvers, you must choose which maneuvers to ready. You ready maneuvers by praying for 5 minutes. The maneuvers you choose remain readied until you decide to pray again and change them. You need not sleep or rest for any long period of time in order to ready your maneuvers; any time you spend 5 minutes in prayer, you can change your readied maneuvers. You begin an encounter with all your readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times you might have already used them since you chose them. When you initiate a maneuver, you expend it for the current encounter, so each of your readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (unless you recover them, as described below). Crusaders are unique among martial adepts, relying on f lashes of divine inspiration to use their martial maneuvers. As such, you do not control access to your readied maneuvers. Before you take your first action in an encounter, two of your readied maneuvers (randomly determined) are granted to you. The rest of your readied maneuvers are withheld, currently inaccessible. At the end of each turn, one previously withheld maneuver (again, randomly determined) is granted to you, and thus becomes accessible for your next turn and subsequent turns. You can freely choose to initiate any maneuver that is currently granted when your turn begins, but you cannot initiate a withheld maneuver. If you choose not to employ a maneuver in a given round, your currently granted maneuvers remain available, and a previously withheld maneuver is granted, as described above. In other words, it doesn't matter if you use your maneuvers or not-at the end of each of your turns, one withheld maneuver from your  selection of readied maneuvers is granted to you. Over the course of a few rounds, all your maneuvers will eventually be granted. If, at the end of your turn, you cannot be granted a maneuver because you have no withheld maneuvers remaining, you recover all expended maneuvers, and a new pair of readied maneuvers is granted to you. Randomly determine which of your maneuvers are granted and which are withheld. At the end of your next turn, a withheld maneuver is granted to you, and the whole process of divine inspiration begins again. You begin an encounter with an additional granted maneuver at 10th level (bringing your total to three), and again at 20th level (bringing your total to four).

10
Stances Known: You begin play with knowledge of one 1st-level stance from the Devoted Spirit, Stone Dragon, or White Raven discipline. At 2nd, 8th, and 14th level, you can choose an additional stance. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended, and you do not have to ready them. All the stances you know are available to you at all times, and you can change the stance you currently use as a swift action. A stance is an extraordinary ability unless otherwise stated in the stance description.
Unlike with maneuvers, you cannot learn a new stance at
higher levels in place of one you already know.
Steely Resolve (Ex): Your supreme dedication and intense focus allow you to temporarily set aside the pain and hindering effects of injuries. When an opponent strikes you, the injury does not immediately affect you. You have a delayed damage pool that allows you to forestall the effects of many injuries. This pool begins at 0 with each encounter. When you are attacked, any hit point damage the blow deals is added to your delayed damage pool. At the end of your next turn, you take damage equal to the total stored in your delayed damage pool, which then resets to 0. Any healing you receive can either increase your current hit point total as normal or reduce the total damage in your delayed damage pool. When you receive healing, you choose whether it affects your damage pool, your hit points, or both (you can split the amount of healing as you wish). Most crusaders opt to keep as much damage in their delayed damage pool as possible to maximize the benefi t of their furious counterstrike ability (see below). Special effects tied to an attack, such as energy drain, stun, and so forth, still affect you as normal, and their effects are not delayed by this ability. For example, if you are bitten by a venomous spider, you must still attempt a Fortitude save against the poison immediately, even though the bite damage shifts into your delayed damage pool. By the same token, any other special attack that imposes a condition, such as a medusa's petrifying gaze, takes immediate effect on you. At 1st level, your delayed damage pool can hold up to 5 points of damage. Any damage beyond that comes off your hit points as normal. The maximum damage your pool holds increases by 5 at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level.
Furious Counterstrike (Ex): You can channel the pain of your injuries into a boiling rage that lets you lash out at your enemies with renewed vigor and power. Each attack that strikes you only pushes you onward to greater glory. During your turn, you gain a bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the current value of your delayed damage pool (see steely resolve, above) divided by 5, and rounding down (minimum +1). You can only gain a maximum bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls of +6 from furious counterstrike. Use the table below to quickly determine the attack bonus and damage bonus from furious counterstrike, based on the amount of damage in your delayed damage pool. This ability's benefits last until the end of your turn.

11
Indomitable Soul (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, you draw upon the power of your unwavering faith to steel yourself against the enemies you face. Your personality, energy, and dedication to your faith make it possible for you to shrug off attacks that target your willpower. You add your Charisma bonus (if any) as a bonus on Will saves. This bonus does not stack with that from a paladin's divine grace ability.
Zealous Surge (Ex): Your boundless energy and dedication to your cause allow you to throw off the effect of a special attack, spell, or other attack that would otherwise hinder or harm you. Once per day, from 3rd level on, you can opt to reroll a single saving throw. You must abide by the result of the new, second saving throw, even if it is lower than the fi rst. This ability does not require an action. You simply decide to use it after seeing the result of your saving throw roll but before the DM tells you if it fails or succeeds.
Smite (Ex): Driven by the courage of your convictions and the ironclad strength of your beliefs, you can strike back at those who dare stand against your cause. Starting at 6th level, once per day, you can concentrate all your anger, hatred, and determination into a single attack. On the next melee attack you make, you gain a bonus on your attack roll equal to your Charisma bonus (if any) and a bonus on damage equal to your crusader level. At 18th level, you gain an additional use of smite per day.
Die Hard (Ex): At 10th level, you gain Die Hard as a bonus feat.
Mettle (Ex): You can resist magical attacks with greater effectiveness than other warriors. Beginning at 13th level, by drawing on your boundless energy and dedication to your cause, you can shrug off effects that would hinder even the toughest warrior. If you succeed on a Fortitude or Will save against an attack that would normally produce a lesser effect on a successful save (such as a spell with a saving throw entry of Will half or Fortitude partial), you instead negate the effect. You do not gain the benefi t of mettle when you are unconscious or sleeping.

# Swordsage
15
Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: As a swordsage, you are profi cient with simple weapons, martial melee weapons (including those that can be used as thrown weapons), and light armor, but not with shields.
Maneuvers: You begin your career with knowledge of six martial maneuvers. The disciplines available to you are Desert Wind, Diamond Mind, Setting Sun, Shadow Hand, Stone Dragon, and Tiger Claw. Once you know a maneuver, you must ready it before you can use it (see Maneuvers Readied, below). A maneuver usable by swordsages is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in its description. Your maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when you initiate one. You learn additional maneuvers at higher levels, as shown on Table 1-2. You must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it. See Table 3-1, page 39, to determine the highest-level maneuvers you can learn. Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered swordsage level after that (6th, 8th, 10th, and so on), you can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one you already know. In effect, you lose the old maneuver in exchange for the new one. You can choose a new maneuver of any level you like, as long as you observe your restriction on the highest- level maneuvers you know; you need not replace the old maneuver with a maneuver of the same level. For example, upon reaching 10th level, you could trade in a single 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd- or 4th-level maneuver for a maneuver of 5th level or lower, as long as you meet the prerequisite of the new maneuver. You can swap only a single maneuver at any given level. Maneuvers Readied: You can ready four of your six maneuvers known at 1st level, and as you advance in level and learn more maneuvers, you are able to ready more, but you must still choose which maneuvers to ready. You ready your maneuvers by meditating and exercising for 5 minutes. The maneuvers you choose remain readied until you decide to meditate again and change them. You need not sleep or rest for any long period of time to ready your maneuvers; any time you spend 5 minutes in meditation, you can change your readied maneuvers. You begin an encounter with all your readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times you might have already used them since you chose them. When you initiate a maneuver, you expend it for the current encounter, so each of your readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (unless you recover them, as described below). You can recover an expended maneuver by using a fullround action to quickly meditate. Doing this does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If you complete your meditation, you can choose one expended maneuver to refresh. It is now available for use in a subsequent round.

16
Stances Known: You begin play with knowledge of one 1st-level stance from any discipline open to you. At 2nd, 5th, 9th, 14th, and 20th level, you can choose additional stances. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended, and you do not have to ready them. All the stances you know are available to you at all times, and you can change the stance you currently use as a swift action. A stance is an extraordinary ability unless otherwise stated in the stance description. Unlike with maneuvers, you cannot learn a new stance at higher levels in place of one you already know.
AC Bonus: Starting at 2nd level, you can add your Wisdom modifi er as a bonus to Armor Class, so long as you wear light armor, are unencumbered, and do not use a shield. This bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks or when you are fl at-footed. However, you lose this bonus when you are immobilized or helpless.
Discipline Focus (Ex): As a swordsage, you can focus your training to take advantage of each discipline's fi ghting style. Each time you gain the discipline focus ability, select one of the six swordsage disciplines to which that focus applies. You can select a different discipline each time you gain discipline focus, but you must know at least one martial maneuver from the selected discipline. Even if you select a different discipline at higher levels, your discipline choice for earlier abilities does not change. This focus manifests in the following ways.
	DESC:&nl;Weapon Focus: At 1st level, you gain the benefi t of the Weapon Focus feat for weapons associated with the chosen discipline. See the discipline descriptions in Chapter 4.
	DESC:&nl;Insightful Strikes: At 4th level, you can add your Wisdom modifi er as a bonus on damage rolls whenever you execute a strike from the chosen discipline. At 12th level, you can choose a second discipline to which this ability applies.
	DESC:&nl;Defensive Stance: At 8th level, you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws whenever you adopt a stance from the chosen discipline. At 16th level, you can choose a second discipline to which this ability applies. You gain a +2 bonus on Martial Lore checks made regarding a maneuver in a discipline in which you have discipline focus.
Quick to Act (Ex): You gain a +1 bonus on initiative checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level.
Sense Magic (Su): Beginning at 7th level, you can spend 10 minutes focusing upon a weapon or suit of armor. If you succeed on a level check (DC 10 + the caster level of the weapon or armor), you can identify the properties of that item, including its enhancement bonus and special abilities. This ability does not reveal the properties of artifacts or legacy weapons, though it does indicate that such items are signifi cantly powerful.

17
Evasion (Ex): At 9th level, you can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If you make a successful Refl ex saving throw against an attack that normally deals damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor. If you are helpless, you do not gain the benefi t of evasion.
Improved Evasion (Ex): From 17th level on, you gain the benefi t of improved evasion. You still take no damage if you make a successful Refl ex save against an attack, and even if you fail the Refl ex save, you take only half damage from the attack. If you are helpless, you do not gain the benefi t of improved evasion.
Dual Boost (Ex): When you reach 20th level, you can use two boost maneuvers simultaneously. Whenever you initiate a boost maneuver, you can also initiate any other boost maneuver that you know as a free action. Both boosts you initiate are expended normally. You can use this ability three times per day.

# Warblade
21
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: You are proficient with simple and martial melee weapons (including those that can be used as thrown weapons), light and medium armor, and all shields except tower shields.
Maneuvers: You begin your career with knowledge of three martial maneuvers. The disciplines available to you are Diamond Mind, Iron Heart, Stone Dragon, Tiger Claw, and White Raven. Once you know a maneuver, you must ready it before you can use it (see Maneuvers Readied, below). A maneuver usable by warblades is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in its description. Your maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when you initiate one. You learn additional maneuvers at higher levels, as shown on Table 1-3. You must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it. See Table 3-1, page 39, to determine the highest-level maneuvers you can learn. Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered warblade level after that (6th, 8th, 10th, and so on), you can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one you already know. In effect, you lose the old maneuver in exchange for the new one. You can choose a new maneuver of any level you like, as long as you observe your restriction on the highest-level maneuvers you know; you need not replace the old maneuver with a maneuver of the same level. For example, upon reaching 10th level, you could trade in a single 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd- or 4th-level maneuver for a maneuver of 5th level or lower, as long as you meet the prerequisite of the new maneuver. You can swap only a single maneuver at any given level.
Maneuvers Readied: You can ready all three of the maneuvers you know at 1st level, but as you advance in level and learn more maneuvers, you must choose which maneuvers to ready. You ready your maneuvers by exercising for 5 minutes. The maneuvers you choose remain readied until you decide to exercise again and change them. You need not sleep or rest for any long period of time to ready your maneuvers; any time you spend 5 minutes in practice, you can change your readied maneuvers. You begin an encounter with all your readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times you might have already used them since you chose them. When you initiate a maneuver, you expend it for the current encounter, so each of your readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (until you recover them, as described below). You can recover all expended maneuvers with a single swift action, which must be immediately followed in the same round with a melee attack or using a standard action to do nothing else in the round (such as executing a quick, harmless fl ourish with your weapon). You cannot initiate a maneuver or change your stance while you are recovering your expended maneuvers, but you can remain in a stance in which you began your turn.

22
Stances Known: You begin play with knowledge of one 1st level stance from any discipline open to warblades. At 4th, 10th, and 16th level, you can choose additional stances. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended, and you do not have to ready them. All the stances you know are available to you at all times, and you can change the stance you are currently using as a swift action. A stance is an extraordinary ability unless otherwise stated in the stance description. Unlike with maneuvers, you cannot learn a new stance at higher levels in place of one you already know.
Battle Clarity (Ex): You can enter a state of almost mystical awareness of the battlefi eld around you. As long as you are not fl at-footed, you gain an insight bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus (maximum equals your warblade level) on your Refl ex saves.
Weapon Aptitude (Ex): Your training with a wide range of weaponry and tactics gives you great skill with particular weapons. You qualify for feats that usually require a minimum number of fi ghter levels (such as Weapon Specialization) as if you had a fi ghter level equal to your warblade level -2. For example, as a 6th-level warblade, you could take Weapon Specialization, since you're treated as being a 4th-level fi ghter for this purpose. These effective fi ghter levels stack with any actual fi ghter levels you have. Thus, a fi ghter 2/warblade 4 would also qualify for Weapon Specialization. You also have the fl exibility to adjust your weapon training. Each morning, you can spend 1 hour in weapon practice to change the designated weapon for any feat you have that applies only to a single weapon (such as Weapon Focus). You must have the newly designated weapon available during your practice session to make this change. For example, if you wish to change the designated weapon for your Weapon Focus feat from greatsword to longsword, you must have a longsword available to practice with during your practice session. You can adjust any number of your feats in this way, and you don't have to adjust them all in the same way. However, you can't change the weapon choices in such a way that you no longer meet the prerequisite for some other feat you possess. For instance, if you have both Weapon Focus (longsword) and Weapon Specialization (longsword), you can't change the designated weapon for Weapon Focus unless you also change the weapon for Weapon Specialization in the same way.
Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 2nd level, you gain the ability to react to danger before your senses would normally allow you to do so. You retain your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if you are caught fl at-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, you still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if you are immobilized. If you already have uncanny dodge from a different class (barbarian or rogue, for example), you automatically gain improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
Battle Ardor (Ex): The sheer love of battle lends uncanny strength to your blows. Starting at 3rd level, you gain an insight bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus on rolls made to confi rm critical hits.
Bonus Feat: At 5th level, you gain a bonus feat from the list given below. You must meet the prerequisite for the feat you select. Every four levels thereafter (at 9th, 13th, and 17th level), you choose another bonus feat from the list. Bonus Feat List: Acrobatic, Agile, Athletic, Blade Meditation*, Blind-Fight, Combat Reflexes, Diehard, Endurance, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Ironheart*, Lightning Refl exes, Quick Draw, Run, Stone Power*, Tiger Blooded*, Unnerving Calm*, White Raven Defense*. *New feats described in Chapter 2.

23
Battle Cunning (Ex): Your instinct for seizing the moment gives you a signifi cant advantage over foes unprepared for your attack. At 7th level, you gain an insight bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus on melee damage rolls against fl at-footed or fl anked opponents.
Battle Skill (Ex): You anticipate your enemies' ploys and tactics. At 11th level, you gain an insight bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus on any check made to oppose an enemy's bull rush, disarm, feint, overrun, sunder, or trip attempt.
Battle Mastery (Ex): You notice the most subtle openings and cues offered by your opponents. At 15th level, you gain an insight bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus on melee attack rolls and melee damage rolls made whenever you make an attack of opportunity.
Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 6th level and higher, you can no longer be flanked; you can react to opponents on opposite sides of you as easily as you can react to a single attacker. See the barbarian class feature (PH 26) for more information.
Stance Mastery (Ex): At 20th level, you can have two stances active simultaneously. When you use a swift action to initiate or change your stance, you can initiate or change one or both stances.

###Block: @Prestige Class

# Bloodclaw Master
97
Maneuvers: At each odd-numbered level, you gain a new maneuver known from the Tiger Claw discipline. You must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it. You add your full bloodclaw master levels to your initiator level to determine your total initiator level and your highest-level maneuvers known. At 3rd level, you gain an additional maneuver readied per day.
Shifting (Su): You can become more like a tiger by focusing your feral nature. Once per day, you can enter a state that is superfi cially similar to a barbarian's rage. While you are shifting, your appearance takes on tigerlike aspects: Your fi ngernails become more pointed and clawlike, the irises of your eyes become narrow, catlike slits, your ears grow more pointed, and so on. While shifting, you gain a +2 bonus to Strength and you grow claws that can be used as natural weapons. These claws deal 1d4 points of damage with each successful attack. You can attack with one claw as a standard action or with two claws as a full attack action (as a primary natural weapon). You cannot attack more than once per round with a single claw, even if your base attack bonus is high enough to give you multiple attacks. You can attack with a claw as a light off-hand weapon while wielding a weapon in your primary hand, but doing so incurs the normal penalties for fi ghting with two weapons. Shifting is a free action and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Con modifi er + your bloodclaw master class level. At 3rd level and again at 5th level, you gain an additional daily use of your shifting ability.
Claws of the Beast (Ex): When attacking with two daggers or Tiger Claw weapons (kukri, kama, handaxe, unarmed strike, or claws), you add your full Strength bonus to damage rolls made for your off-hand weapon.
Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, when you attack with two daggers or Tiger Claw weapons, you do not take the -2 penalty on attack rolls for fi ghting with two weapons.
Tiger Claw Synergy (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, while you are in a Tiger Claw stance, you can choose to gain either a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class or a +10-foot bonus to your base speed. You make this choice when you enter the stance. At 4th level, you become more accurate at dealing Tiger Claw strikes. You gain a +1 bonus on any attack rolls made as part of a strike from the Tiger Claw discipline.
Pouncing Strike (Ex): From 3rd level on, when wielding two weapons, you can take a standard action to make a single melee attack with each weapon. Each attack is made at your highest attack bonus. You can also make an attack with each weapon against an opponent at the end of a charge. When you use pouncing strike, you lose the use of one Tiger Claw strike you have readied for the current encounter, just as if you had initiated the strike (except you do not also gain the strike's normal effect). Once you use this ability, you can recover the maneuver you expended and use it normally.
Low-Light Vision (Ex): At 3rd level, your eyes function better in dim light, as you adopt the senses of the tiger. You gain low-light vision.

98
Rending Claws (Ex): At 5th level, while you are shifting and attacking with two daggers or two Tiger Claw weapons and you successfully hit an opponent with both weapons in the same round, the second weapon that hits deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. This effect is considered a boost from the Tiger Claw discipline. When you use rending claws, you lose the use of one Tiger Claw boost you have readied for the current encounter, just as if you had initiated the boost (except you do not also gain the boost's normal effect). Once you use this ability, you can recover the maneuver you expended and use it normally. Scent (Ex): Once you have reached 5th level, your heightened animalistic senses also give you the ability to smell nearby creatures. You gain the scent special ability (MM 314).

# Bloodstorm Blade
100

Returning Attacks (Ex): You can hurl your weapon at a
foe and command it to ricochet back to you. Any weapon you
throw behaves as though it has the returning special ability
(DMG 225).
When you use returning attacks, you lose the use of one
Iron Heart strike you have readied for the current encounter,
just as if you had initiated the strike (except you do
not also gain the strike's normal effect). Once you use this
ability, you can recover the maneuver you expended and
use it normally.
Throw Anything: As an initiate of the mysteries of the
bloodstorm technique, you learn to throw swords as easily
as others hurl daggers. You gain Throw Anything (see the
sidebar) as a bonus feat.
Weapon Aptitude (Ex): Your training with a wide range
of weaponry and tactics allows you the opportunity to gain
great skill with particular weapons. You can qualify for
feats requiring a minimum number of fi ghter levels (such as
Weapon Specialization) as if you had a fi ghter level equal to
your combined warblade and bloodstorm blade levels -2.
Furthermore, you have the fl exibility to adjust your weapon
training. Each morning, you can spend 1 hour practicing
and change the weapons selected for any feat you have that
applies only to a single chosen weapon. For example, you

101
could change your Weapon Focus (greataxe) feat so its benefi t
applies to longswords instead.
You can adjust any number of your feats in this way, and you
don't have to adjust them all in the same way. You can't change
the weapon choices in such a way that you no longer meet a feat's
prerequisite. For instance, you must be profi cient with a weapon
chosen for Weapon Focus; and if you have both Weapon Focus
and Weapon Specialization with the longsword, you couldn't
change Weapon Focus without also changing Weapon Specialization
to the same weapon. You must also have that weapon
available during practice; if you don't have a longsword handy,
you can't assign your feats to affect longswords.
Martial Throw (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, you can initiate
a strike from the Iron Heart
discipline with a thrown
weapon. The strike must
be one that has a target
of one creature. A
strike that targets
multiple creatures
or objects cannot
be used with martial
throw.
Thunderous
Throw (Ex):
Beginning
at 2nd level,
you build up
incredible tension
as you ready
yourself to throw
your weapon,
which becomes
visible around
you like heat waves.
When you release
your weapon, that power
rushes out with your weapon.
As a swift action, you can choose to treat your
ranged attack rolls with thrown weapons as melee attacks
for the rest of your turn. You use your melee attack bonus,
including Strength bonus, feats, and so forth, to determine
your attack bonus for each attack as normal, but you apply the
standard modifi ers for range penalties. Attacking into melee,
through cover, and so forth incurs the standard penalties.
In addition, you can apply 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus
to damage if you wield the thrown weapon with two hands,
and you can use Power Attack with your thrown weapon
attacks (adding two times the number subtracted from attack
rolls as a bonus on damage rolls when throwing a twohanded
weapon).
Bonus Fighter Feat: Bloodstorm blades study all aspects
of combat as they learn to rain blows down upon distant foes
and enemies close at hand. At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, you gain
a bonus feat chosen from the list of fi ghter bonus feats. You
must meet the prerequisite of the feat to take it.
Lightning Ricochet (Ex): From 4th level on, you can
throw your weapon at a nearby foe and command it to
immediately bounce back to your grasp. Any time you make
a ranged attack with a thrown weapon on your turn, the
weapon immediately returns to you, and you can catch it as
a free action. This ability allows you to make a full attack
entirely with thrown weapon attacks, or with a mix of thrown
and melee attacks.
Blood Wind
Ricochet (Ex): As
a full-round action,
at 5th level
and higher, you
can hurl a weapon
at a foe and
compel it to ricochet
to other
enemies before
hurtling back
to your waiting
hand. The weapon
you throw behaves as
though it has the returning
special ability (DMG 225), except
that you determine the point
during your turn when the weapon
returns to you.
When using this ability, you
make a full attack with a thrown
weapon, but each ranged attack must be resolved
against a separate target. You can choose the
order in which you attack your foes. Range and cover penalties
are resolved for each attack after the fi rst as though that
attack originated from the space of the creature you last
attacked. If a creature has total cover relative to you, you
cannot attack it.
When you use blood wind ricochet, you lose the use
of one Iron Heart strike you have readied for the current
encounter, just as if you had initiated the strike (except you
do not also gain the strike's normal effect). Once you use this

102
ability, you can recover the maneuver you expended and use
it normally.
Eye of the Storm (Ex): At 7th level, you learn to center
your being and adopt a mindset of calm readiness despite the
furor of battle raging about you. While you are in an Iron
Heart stance, you can forgo its normal benefi t as a swift action
to gain the effect of eye of the storm. This ability lasts as long
as you would maintain the Iron Heart stance, or as described
below. You can also stop using eye of the storm and resume
gaining the normal benefi t of the stance as a swift action.
When you use this ability, you gain a +4 dodge bonus to
Armor Class against ranged attacks and a +2 competence
bonus on Refl ex saves. In addition, when a foe makes an attack
of opportunity against you when you make a ranged attack
while threatened, you can make a single melee attack against
that foe as a swift action (assuming you're not unarmed and
you threaten the foe). Such an attack does not count as an
attack of opportunity. To retain this defensive posture, you
can move no more than 10 feet on your turn.
Blood Rain (Ex): Beginning at 8th level, you can enter a
state that enables you to infl ict a terrible bleeding wound on
any living creature you damage with a thrown weapon or a
melee attack. While you are in an Iron Heart stance, you can
forgo its normal benefi t as a swift action to gain the effect of
blood rain. This ability lasts as long as you would maintain
the Iron Heart stance, or as described below. You can also
stop using blood rain and resume gaining the normal benefi t
of the stance as a swift action.
The creature you hit with your attack takes 3 points of
damage due to blood loss at the beginning of your turn
each round. This effect ends if you stop using the stance. An
affected creature can end the effect by being the benefi ciary
of any healing (such as a cure spell) or a DC 15 Heal check.
The bleeding effect of blood rain does not stack with itself
or the blood rain ability of another bloodstorm blade.
Blade Storm (Ex): At 10th level, you can hurl your weapon
as a full-round action to make it seem as if you are attacking a
dozen foes at once. You become the center of a storm of steel as
your thrown weapon fl ies out to strike a foe, returns to ricochet
harmlessly off you, then fl ies out to attack another foe.
You can make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon at
your highest attack bonus against as many targets as you
wish. You can attack each target just once with this attack,
calculating range and cover penalties from your position on
the battlefi eld.
When you use blade storm, you lose the use of one Iron
Heart strike you have readied for the current encounter, just
as if you had initiated the strike (except you do not also gain
the strike's normal effect). Once you use this ability, you can
recover the maneuver you expended and use it normally.

# Deepstone Sentinel
105
Maneuvers: At each odd-numbered level, you gain a new
maneuver known from the Stone Dragon discipline. You
must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it. You add
your full deepstone sentinel levels to your initiator level to
determine your total initiator level and your highest-level
maneuvers known.
At 3rd level, you gain an additional maneuver readied
per day.
Mountain Fortress Stance (Su): As a novice deepstone
sentinel, you learn to make yourself as impenetrable as a
mountain fortress. This ability is a key component of this
prestige class's combat abilities. While you are in a Stone
Dragon stance, you can forgo its normal benefi t as a swift
action to gain the effect of mountain fortress stance. This
ability lasts as long as you would maintain the Stone Dragon
stance, or as described below. You can also stop using mountain
fortress stance and resume gaining the normal benefi t
of the stance as a swift action.
When you use this ability, you can choose to create a fortress
of earth or rock, provided you are standing on earth,
stone, rock, or a worked surface such as a cobblestone street
or a fl agstone fl oor (as long as natural earth or rock is no
more than 1 foot below you). The square (or squares) that you
occupy forms a pillar of earth or rock 5 feet tall, with you on
top. Each square adjacent to you is buckled and steeply sloped,
becoming diffi cult terrain. Any creature that attempts to
enter or leave one of these squares must make a DC 10 Balance
check or fall prone in the last square of the area it occupied.
Creatures that ignore diffi cult terrain automatically succeed
on this check, and fl ying creatures are unaffected. Creatures
with four or more legs or the stability racial trait gain a +4
bonus on this Balance check.
You retain the benefi t of mountain fortress stance until
you end your Stone Dragon stance or move more than 5 feet
in a round. You are unaffected by the diffi cult terrain you
create with this ability. If you move only 5 feet in a round,
the pillar of earth you have created moves with you, creating
new squares of diffi cult terrain in every square adjacent to
your new position. If creatures occupy those newly adjacent
squares, they do not need to immediately make Balance
