Appraise Magic Value	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.103																									PRESKILL:3,Appraise=5,Knowledge (Arcana)=5,Spellcraft=5				DESC:Your ability to determine an item's worth and your knowledge of magic allow you to determine the exact properties of a magic item without the use of the identify spell or similar magic.	BENEFIT:If you know that an item is magical, you can use the Appraise skill to identify the item's properties. This use of the Appraise skill requires 8 hours of uninterrupted work and consumes 25 gp worth of special materials. The DC of the Appraise check is 10 + the caster level of the item.
Ascetic Hunter		TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	PREFEAT:1,Improved Unarmed Strike	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.FavoredEnemy																													DESC:You have gone beyond the bounds of your monastic training to incorporate new modes of bringing the unlawful to justice. Although many of your fellow monks frown on your methods, none can doubt that your diverse training has added to your ability to strike precisely and bring down your foes quickly.	BENEFIT:When you use an unarmed strike to deliver a stunning attack against a favored enemy, you can add one-half your favored enemy bonus on damage rolls to the DC of your stunning attempt. If you have levels in ranger and monk, those levels stack for the purpose of determining your unarmed strike damage. For example, a human 7th-level ranger/1stlevel monk would deal 1d10 points of damage with her unarmed strike. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the monk and ranger classes. You must still remain lawful in order to retain your monk abilities and take monk levels. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
# All CAPS means entered, but the PRExxx aren't in place
ASCETIC KNIGHT		TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:You belong to a special order of religious monks that teaches its adherents that self-enlightenment and honorable service grow from the same well of purity. As a student of this philosophy, you have blended your training as a paladin and as a monk into one seamless whole.	PRETEXT:Improved Unarmed Strike, ability to smite evil.	BENEFIT: Your paladin and monk levels stack for the purpose of determining your unarmed strike damage. For example, a human 3rd-level paladin/1st-level monk would deal 1d8 points of damage with her unarmed strike. Your paladin and monk levels also stack when determining the extra damage dealt by your smite evil ability. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the paladin and monk classes. You must still remain lawful good in order to retain your paladin abilities and take paladin levels, and you must remain lawful in order to continue advancing as a monk. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
ASCETIC MAGE		TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:You practice an unusual martial art that mixes self-taught spellcasting and melee attacks to great effect.	PRETEXT:Improved Unarmed Strike, ability to spontaneously cast 2nd-level arcane spells.	BENEFIT: As a swift action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, you can sacrifice one of your daily allotment of spells to add a bonus to your unarmed strike attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round. The bonus is equal to the level of the spell sacrificed. The spell is lost as if you had cast it. If you have levels in sorcerer and monk, those levels stack for the purpose of determining your AC bonus. For example, a human 4th-level sorcerer/1st-level monk would have a +1 bonus to AC as if she were a 5th-level monk. If you would normally be allowed to add your Wisdom bonus to AC (such as for a unarmored, unencumbered monk), you instead add your Charisma bonus (if any) to your AC. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the sorcerer and monk classes. You must still remain lawful in order to continue advancing as a monk. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.

ASCETIC ROGUE		TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:You have gone beyond the bounds of your monastic training to incorporate new modes of stealthy combat. Although your fellow monks may frown on your methods, none can doubt that your diverse training has improved your ability to strike precisely and bring down your foes quickly.	PRETEXT:Improved Unarmed Strike, sneak attack.	BENEFIT: When you use an unarmed strike with a sneak attack to deliver a stunning attack, you add 2 to the DC of your stunning attempt. If you have levels in rogue and monk, those levels stack for the purpose of determining your unarmed strike damage. For example, a human 5th-level rogue/1st-level monk would deal 1d8 points of damage with her unarmed strike. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the monk and rogue classes. You must still remain lawful in order to retain your monk abilities and take monk levels. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
BRACHIATION			TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:You can swing through trees like a monkey.	PRETEXT:Climb 4 ranks, Jump 4 ranks.	BENEFIT: You can move through wooded areas at your base land speed, ignoring any effects on movement due to terrain. You must be at least 20 feet from the ground to use this ability. This ability works only in medium and dense forests (see page 87 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
BRUTAL THROW		TYPE:General.Fighter	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:You have learned how to hurl weapons to deadly effect.	BENEFIT:You can add your Strength modifier (instead of your Dexterity modifier) to attack rolls with thrown weapons. Normal: A character attacking with a ranged weapon adds his Dexterity modifier to the attack roll. Special: A fighter may select Brutal Throw as one of his fighter bonus feats.
COMBAT INTUITION		TYPE:General.Fighter	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:Your keen understanding of your opponent's moves and your instinctive feel for the flow of combat enable you to shrewdly assess your opponent's combat capabilities.
	PRETEXT:Sense Motive 4 ranks, base attack bonus +5.
	BENEFIT:As a free action, you can use Sense Motive to assess the challenge presented by a single opponent in relationship to your own level/Hit Dice (see the assess opponent option under the Sense Motive skill, page 102). You gain a +4 bonus on such checks and narrow the result to a single category. In addition, whenever you make a melee attack against a creature that you made a melee attack against during the previous round, you gain a +1 insight bonus on your melee attack rolls against that creature. Special: A fighter may select Combat Intuition as one of his fighter bonus feats.
DANGER SENSE	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:You are one twitchy individual.
	PRETEXT:Improved Initiative.
	BENEFIT:Once per day, you can reroll an initiative check you have just made. You use the better of your two rolls. You must decide to reroll before the round starts.
DEATH BLOW	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:You waste no time in dealing with downed foes.
	PRETEXT:Improved Initiative, base attack bonus +2.
	BENEFIT:You can perform a coup de grace attack against a helpless defender as a standard action. Doing this still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. Normal: Performing a coup de grace is a full-round action.
DEFT OPPORTUNIST	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:You are prepared for the unexpected.
	PRETEXT:Dex 15, Combat Reflexes.
	BENEFIT:You get a +4 bonus on attack rolls when making attacks of opportunity.
DEFT STRIKE	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:You can place attacks at weak points in your opponent's defenses.
	PRETEXT:Int 13, Combat Expertise, Spot 10 ranks, sneak attack.
	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can attempt to find a weak point in a visible target's armor. This requires a Spot check against a DC equal to your target's Armor Class. If you succeed, your next attack against that target (which must be made no later than your next turn) ignores the target's armor bonus and natural armor bonus to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to armor or natural armor). Other AC bonuses still apply normally. If you use a ranged weapon to deliver the attack, your opponent must be within 30 feet of you in order for you to benefit from this feat.
DEVOTED INQUISITOR	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:Your faithful service to your patron deity involves training and methods that many paladins consider questionable. By using the unconventional methods of rogues and assassins, you have learned to deliver devastating sneak attacks against evil foes.
	PRETEXT:Smite evil, sneak attack.
	BENEFIT:When you successfully use your sneak attack ability and your smite evil ability against the same foe in a single attack, you can potentially daze your foe. An opponent affected by both abilities must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the paladin and rogue classes. You must still remain lawful good in order to retain your paladin abilities and take paladin levels. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
DEVOTED PERFORMER	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:You have foregone the pursuit of frivolous musical talents, instead entering religious training in service of honor and justice.
	PRETEXT:Bardic music, smite evil.
	BENEFIT:If you have levels in paladin and bard, those levels stack for the purpose of determining the bonus damage dealt by your smite evil ability and determining the number of times per day that you can use your bardic music. This feat does not allow additional daily uses of smite evil or bardic music abilities beyond what your class levels would normally allow. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the paladin and bard classes and may even gain additional bard levels regardless of your lawful alignment. You must still remain lawful good in order to retain your paladin abilities and take paladin levels. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
DEVOTED TRACKER	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:You have found a balance between your woodland training and your devotion to religious training, blending these two aspects into one seamless whole.
	PRETEXT:Track, smite evil, wild empathy.
	BENEFIT:If you have levels in paladin and ranger, those levels stack for the purposes of determining the extra damage dealt by your smite evil ability and determining the bonus for your wild empathy class feature. This feat does not allow additional daily uses of smite evil. If you have both the special mount and animal companion class features, you can designate your special mount as your animal companion. The mount gains all the benefits of being both your special mount and your animal companion. For instance, a 5th-level paladin/6th-level ranger's special mount would have 4 bonus Hit Dice, a +6 natural armor adjustment, +2 Strength, +1 Dexterity, two bonus tricks, and Intelligence 6, as well as the empathic link, improved evasion, share spells, share saving throws, and link special abilities. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the paladin and ranger classes. You must still remain lawful good in order to retain your paladin abilities and take paladin levels. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
DISGUISE SPELL	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:You can cast spells without observers noticing.
	PRETEXT:Perform (any) 9 ranks, bardic music.
	BENEFIT:You can cast spells unobtrusively, mingling verbal and somatic components into your performances. To disguise a spell, make a Perform check as part of the action used to cast the spell. Onlookers must match or exceed your check result with a Spot check to detect that you're casting a spell (your performance is obvious to everyone in the vicinity, but the fact that you are casting a spell isn't). Unless the spell visibly emanates from you, or observers have some other means of determining its source, they don't know where the effect came from. A disguised spell can't be identified with a Spellcraft check, even by someone who realizes you're casting a spell. The act of casting still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.
DIVE FOR COVER	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:You can dive behind cover or drop to the ground quickly enough to avoid many area effects.
	PRETEXT:Base Reflex save bonus +4.
	BENEFIT:If you fail a Reflex saving throw, you can immediately attempt the saving throw again. You must take the second result, whether it succeeds or fails. You become prone immediately after attempting the second roll.
DUAL STRIKE	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:You are an expert skirmisher skilled at fighting with two weapons. Your extensive training with two weapons allows you to attack with both while moving through a chaotic combat or fighting a running battle.
	PRETEXT:Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Two- Weapon Fighting.
	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can make a melee attack with your primary weapon and your off-hand weapon. Both attacks use the same attack roll to determine success, using the worse of the two weapons' attack modifiers. If you are using a one-handed or light weapon in your primary hand and a light weapon in your off hand, you take a -4 penalty on this attack roll; otherwise you take a -10 penalty. Each weapon deals its normal damage. Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each weapon attack. Special: When you make this attack, you apply precision- based damage (such as from sneak attack) only once. If you score a critical hit, only the weapon in your primary hand deals extra critical hit damage; your offhand weapon deals regular damage. A fighter may select Dual Strike as one of his fighter bonus feats.
EXPERT TACTICIAN	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:Your tactical skills work to your advantage.
	PRETEXT:Dex 13, Combat Reflexes, base attack bonus +2.
	BENEFIT:If you hit a creature with an attack of opportunity, you and all your allies gain a +2 circumstance bonus on melee attack rolls and damage rolls against that creature for 1 round.
EXTRA MUSIC	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:You can use your bardic music more often than you otherwise could.
	PRETEXT:Bardic music.
	BENEFIT:You can use your bardic music four extra times per day. Normal: Bards without the Extra Music feat can use bardic music once per day per bard level. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.
EXTRAORDINARY CONCENTRATION	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:Your mind is so focused that you can cast spells even while concentrating on another spell.
	PRETEXT:Concentration 15 ranks.
	BENEFIT:When concentrating to maintain a spell, you can make a Concentration check (DC 25 + spell level) to maintain concentration with just a move action. If you beat the DC by 10 or more, you can maintain concentration on the spell as a swift action (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137). Using this ability is a free action, but if you fail the Concentration check, you lose concentration on the maintained spell and its effect ends. This feat does not give you the ability to maintain concentration on more than one spell at a time. Normal: Concentrating on a spell is a standard action.
EXTRAORDINARY SPELL AIM	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:You can shape a spell's area to exclude one creature from its effects.
	PRETEXT:Spellcraft 15 ranks.
	BENEFIT:Whenever you cast a spell with an area, you can attempt to shape the spell's area so that one creature within the area is unaffected by the spell. To accomplish this, you must succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 25 + spell level). Casting a spell affected by the Extraordinary Spell Aim feat requires a full-round action unless the spell's normal casting time is longer, in which case the casting time is unchanged.
FORCE OF PERSONALITY	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:You have cultivated an unshakable belief in your selfworth. Your sense of self and purpose are so strong that they bolster your willpower.
	PRETEXT:Cha 13.
	BENEFIT:You add your Charisma modifier (instead of your Wisdom modifier) to Will saves against mind-affecting spells and abilities.
GOAD	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:You are skilled at inducing opponents to attack you.
	PRETEXT:Cha 13, base attack bonus +1.
	BENEFIT:As a move action, you can goad an opponent that threatens you, has line of sight to you, can hear you, and has an Intelligence of 3 or higher. (The goad is a mind-affecting ability.) When the goaded opponent starts its next turn, if it threatens you and has line of sight to you, it must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier). If the opponent fails its save, you are the only creature it can make melee attacks against during this turn. (If it kills you, knocks you unconscious, loses sight of you, or otherwise is unable to make melee attacks against you, it may make any remaining melee attacks against other foes, as normal.) A goaded creature can still cast spells, make ranged attacks, move, or perform other actions normally. The use of this feat restricts only melee attacks. Special: A fighter may select Goad as one of his fighter bonus feats.
