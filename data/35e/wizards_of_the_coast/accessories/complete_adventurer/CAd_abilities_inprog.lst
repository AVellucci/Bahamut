SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Animal lords gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Animal Bond (Ex): An animal lord develops a bond with animals of his selected group (see below). He gains a +4 bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy checks made to influence animals from his chosen group. If an animal lord has the animal companion class feature, he adds his animal lord level to his effective druid level for the purpose of determining his animal companion's bonus Hit Dice, special abilities, and so forth. The eight groups of animals included here, along with examples taken from the Monster Manual, are as follows.
	DESC:Apelord: ape, baboon, dire ape, monkey.
	DESC:Bearlord: black bear, brown bear, dire bear, polar bear.
	DESC:Birdlord: eagle, giant eagle*, giant owl*, hawk, owl, raven.
	DESC:Catlord: cat, cheetah, dire lion, dire tiger, leopard, lion, tiger.
	DESC:Horselord: horse (all), pony, warpony.
	DESC:Sharklord: dire shark, shark (all).
	DESC:Snakelord: constrictor, giant constrictor, viper (all).
	DESC:Wolflord: dire wolf, wolf.
Detect Animals (Sp): Beginning at 1st level, an animal lord can detect the presence of any animals of his selected group at will, as if using detect animals or plants with a caster level equal to his class level.
Wild Empathy (Ex): An animal lord can improve the attitude of an animal. See the druid class feature, page 35 of the Player's Handbook. If an animal lord has wild empathy from another class, his levels stack for determining the bonus.
First Totem: At 2nd level, an animal lord gains a +4 bonus on checks made with a specific skill, determined by his selected group as follows. Apelord: Climb; Bearlord: Intimidate; Birdlord: Spot; Catlord: Move Silently; Horselord: Jump; Sharklord: Swim; Snakelord: Escape Artist; Wolflord: Survival.
Low-Light Vision (Ex): At 2nd level, an animal lord gains low-light vision, allowing him to see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of shadowy illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions. If an animal lord already has low-light vision from another source (such as his race), his low-light vision improves, allowing him to see three times as far as a human in conditions of shadowy illumination.

Wild Aspect (Su)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, an animal lord can take on an aspect of the animals of his selected group. Assuming a wild aspect is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137). Unless otherwise noted, the effect lasts for 1 minute per level. An animal lord can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels gained after 3rd (twice per day at 6th level and three times per day at 9th level). When an animal lord reaches 7th level, his wild aspect becomes more powerful, as described below. If an animal lord has the wild shape ability, he can spend one daily use of wild shape to assume his wild aspect instead (the duration is as normal for the wild aspect). If an animal lord already has a natural attack of the type gained by his wild aspect, use whichever damage figure is superior while the wild aspect is active. If an animal lord wields a weapon while using his wild aspect, he can use the natural attacks gained as natural secondary weapons if he uses his weapon as a primary attack, provided they are still available (an apelord couldn't use a secondary claw attack, for example, if he wields a twohanded weapon).
	DESC:Apelord: An apelord gains two primary claw attacks. Each claw deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for Small apelords). If an apelord hits an opponent with both claw attacks, he rends the foe for an additional 2d4 points of damage (or 2d3 points for Small apelords), plus 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus. At 7th level, the claw damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small apelords) and the rend damage to 2d6 points (or 2d4 points for Small apelords).
	DESC:Bearlord: A bearlord gains two primary claw attacks. Each claw deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for Small bearlords). If a bearlord hits with a claw attack, he can attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The bearlord still follows all the other normal grappling rules. At 7th level, the claw damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small bearlords).
	DESC:Birdlord: A birdlord grows feathery wings, allowing him to fly at his base land speed (average maneuverability). At 7th level, the duration increases to 10 minutes per level.
	DESC:Catlord: A catlord gains two primary claw attacks. Each claw deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for Small catlords). If a catlord charges, he can attack with both claws at the end of his charge. At 7th level, the claw damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small catlords).
	DESC:Horselord: A horselord's speed, as well as the speed of any horse upon which he rides, improves by 10 feet for a duration of 1 hour per level. At 7th level, the speed increase improves to 20 feet.
	DESC:Sharklord: A sharklord gains a devastating bite as a primary natural attack. The bite deals 1d8 points of damage (or 1d6 points for Small sharklords). A sharklord also gains the ability to breathe water while his wild aspect is active. At 7th level, the bite damage increases to 2d6 points (or 1d8 points for Small sharklords).
	DESC:Snakelord: A snakelord gains a poisonous bite as a primary natural attack for 1 round per level. This bite deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for Small snakelords). The poison's Fortitude save DC is 10 + animal lord level + Con modifier, and it deals initial and secondary damage of 1d3 points of Constitution. At 7th level, the bite damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small snakelords), and the initial and secondary poison damage increases to 1d4 points of Constitution.
	DESC:Wolflord: A wolflord gains the scent ability (see page 314 of the Monster Manual) for 10 minutes per level. At 7th level, the duration increases to 1 hour per level.
Speak with Animals (Sp)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, an animal lord can use speak with animals (as the spell) once per day to converse with animals of his selected group.

Summon Animal (Sp)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 5th level, an animal lord can summon one or more animals of his selected group once per day. This ability functions identically to summon nature's ally V, except that an animal lord can summon creatures only from his selected group, as detailed below. The duration of the effect is 1 minute per class level.
	DESC:Apelord: 1d3 dire apes or 1d4+1 apes.
	DESC:Bearlord: 1 polar bear, 1d3 brown bears, or 1d4+1 black bears.
	DESC:Birdlord: 1d4+1 eagles, [giant eagles, giant owls1 - May be summoned only by nonevil birdlords.], hawks, ravens, or owls.
	DESC:Catlord: 1 dire lion, 1d3 tigers, or 1d4+1 lions.
	DESC:Horselord: 1d4+1 heavy horses, heavy warhorses, light horses, light warhorses, ponies, or warponies.
	DESC:Sharklord: 1d3 Huge sharks or 1d4+1 Large sharks [May be summoned only into an aquatic or watery environment.].
	DESC:Snakelord: 1 giant constrictor snake, 1d3 Huge vipers, or 1d4+1 constrictor snakes or Large vipers.
	DESC:Wolflord: 1d4+1 dire wolves or wolves.


Second Totem	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 6th level, an animal lord gains a bonus feat related to his selected group, even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites. If the animal lord already has the feat, he can choose any other feat for which he meets the prerequisites. Apelord: Brachiation?; Bearlord: Improved Grapple; Birdlord: Flyby Attack (see page 303 of the Monster Manual); Catlord: Lightning Reflexes; Horselord: Trample; Sharklord: Improved Critical (bite); Snakelord: Improved Initiative; Wolflord: Improved Trip. ?New feat described on page 106.
Animal Growth (Sp)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Once per day, an animal lord of 7th level or higher can use animal growth on a single animal from his selected group as a swift action (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137) as a spellcaster of his class level. This ability otherwise functions just like the spell.
Animal Telepathy (Su)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 8th level, an animal lord can converse telepathically with any animal of his selected group that he can see within 100 feet.
Third Totem	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, an animal lord gains a permanent 2-point increase to one of his ability scores, determined by his chosen animal group as follows. Apelord: +2 Strength; Bearlord: +2 Constitution; Birdlord: +2 Wisdom; Catlord: +2 Dexterity; Horselord: +2 Constitution; Sharklord: +2 Strength; Snakelord: +2 Charisma; Wolflord: +2 Strength.



Weapon and Armor Profi ciency	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beastmasters gain no profi ciency with any weapon or armor.
Animal Companion (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A beastmaster gains the service of a loyal animal companion. See the druid class feature, pages 35-36 of the Player's Handbook. Treat the beastmaster as a druid whose level is equal to the beastmaster's class level + 3. A beastmaster can select one of the animals available to a 1st-level druid and then apply the modifi cations as appropriate for a 4th-level druid's animal companion, or she can select a typical version of one of the animals available to a 4th-level druid. As a beastmaster gains class levels, her animal companion gains Hit Dice and other special abilities just as a druid's animal companion does. Use the beastmaster's class level + 3 to determine the animal companion's special abilities. If a beastmaster already has an animal companion from another class, her beastmaster class levels stack with class levels from all other classes that grant an animal companion. For example, a 5th-level druid/2nd-level beastmaster would be treated as a 10th-level druid for the purpose of improving the statistics of her animal companion (and which alternative animal companions she could select).
Wild Empathy (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A beastmaster can improve the attitude of an animal. See the druid class feature, page 35 of the Player's Handbook. If a beastmaster has wild empathy from another class, her levels stack for determining the bonus.
Alertness	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A beastmaster's senses grow keen as she learns some of the tricks of the animal kingdom. Accordingly, she gains Alertness as a bonus feat at 2nd level.



Speak with Animals (Sp)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, a beastmaster can use speak with animals once per day as the spell cast by a caster of her class level. She can use this ability twice per day at 6th level and three times per day at 9th level.
Extra Animal Companion (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level, a beastmaster gains a second animal companion, chosen from the list of animal companions available to a 1st-level druid. Treat the beastmaster as a druid whose level is equal to the beastmaster's class level - 3 for the purpose of improving the animal companion's statistics (or of selecting an alternative companion at higher levels). At 7th level, a beastmaster gains a third animal companion, chosen from the list of animal companions available to a 1st-level druid. Treat the beastmaster as a druid whose level is equal to the beastmaster's class level - 6 for the purpose of improving the animal companion's statistics (or of selecting an alternative companion at higher levels). At 10th level, a beastmaster gains a fourth animal companion, chosen from the list of animal companions available to a 1st-level druid. Treat the beastmaster as a druid whose level is equal to the beastmaster's class level - 9 for the purpose of improving the animal companion's statistics (or of selecting an alternative companion at higher levels). Other class levels in classes that offer an animal companion don't stack for the purpose of determining the power of a beastmaster's additional animal companions, nor do they allow her to choose additional animal companions from the alternative lists.
Low-Light Vision (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, a beastmaster gains low-light vision, allowing her to see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of shadowy illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions. If she already has low-light vision from another source (such as her race), her low-light vision improves, allowing her to see three times as far as a human in conditions of shadowy illumination.
Scent (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 8th level, a beastmaster gains the scent ability (see page 314 of the Monster Manual).


###Block: Bloodhound	
Weapon and Armor Profi ciency	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Bloodhounds are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor.
Mark (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A bloodhound can target, or mark, an individual humanoid or monstrous humanoid foe to better hunt that enemy. To do so, the bloodhound must focus on a foe who is present and visible, or on the depiction or description of one who is not, for 10 minutes. Any interruption ruins the attempt and forces the bloodhound to start the process again. Once this study is complete, that target is called a mark. A bloodhound adds his bloodhound level as an insight bonus on all Gather Information, Listen, Search, Spot, and Survival checks made to determine the whereabouts of a mark. As a bloodhound gains levels, he gains additional abilities that can be used against a mark. If a bloodhound chooses a new mark before apprehending an existing one, the latter becomes unmarked, and the bloodhound loses experience points equal to the amount he would have earned for defeating that creature. A bloodhound can choose a mark only once a week. Initially, a bloodhound can have only one mark at a time. For every three bloodhound levels gained beyond 1st, a bloodhound can have one additional mark, but only if all the marks are chosen during the same process (see above). For example, a 4th-level bloodhound could mark two bugbears in the same group of prisoners, or the depictions of a bugbear and a hobgoblin if both were studied at the same time. If a bloodhound gives up on apprehending any of his marks, all remaining marked creatures become unmarked as described above.
Swift Tracker (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A bloodhound can move at his normal speed while following tracks. See the ranger class feature, page 48 of the Player's Handbook.
Nonlethal Force (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a bloodhound can use a melee weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage instead without taking the usual -4 penalty on his attack roll.
Ready and Waiting (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a bloodhound is ready for trickery at all times. He can ready an action against his mark, even outside of the initiative sequence. If the mark triggers the bloodhound's readied action at any point within the next 10 minutes, the bloodhound can carry out his readied action as if the two were engaged in combat (as long as the bloodhound is capable of carrying out that action). If the bloodhound is incapable of carrying out the action-for instance, if he is too far away to strike the mark with a readied melee attack-the readied action is lost.
Bring 'em Back Alive (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, a bloodhound can turn a potentially killing blow into an incapacitating one-all the better to bring a mark back for punishment. At the bloodhound's option, any melee attack that would reduce a foe to -2 or fewer hit points reduces the foe to -1 hit points instead. A bloodhound must choose to use this ability immediately upon reducing his foe to -2 or fewer hit points, and before making any other action (or even continuing a full attack). A raging bloodhound can't use this ability.
Tenacious Pursuit (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level and above, a bloodhound tracking a mark gains a +4 bonus on Constitution checks made to resist nonlethal damage from a forced march (see page 164 of the Player's Handbook). In addition, a bloodhound tracking a mark can increase his own speed by 10 feet, up to a maximum value equal to the mark's speed. This bonus stacks with all other speed increases. At 6th level, the speed increase improves to 20 feet, and it goes up to 30 feet at 9th level.
Hunter's Dedication (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a bloodhound adds his Constitution bonus (if any) to Will saves made to resist the special attacks or spells of his mark.
Move Like the Wind (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 4th level, a bloodhound can move stealthily even at a quick pace. He no longer takes a -5 penalty on Hide and Move Silently checks when moving at any speed up to his normal speed, and he takes only a -10 penalty (instead of a -20 penalty) on Hide and Move Silently checks when running. (He takes the normal -20 penalty when attacking or charging.)



Crippling Strike (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 5th level, a bloodhound can deliver strikes against his mark with such precision that each successful attack also deals 2 points of Strength damage to the mark. A bloodhound can deliver a crippling strike with a melee attack, or with a ranged attack from a distance of up to 30 feet. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the Player's Handbook.
Track the Trackless (Su)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 5th level, a bloodhound can track a creature moving under the influence of pass without trace or a similar effect, though he takes a -20 penalty on his Survival checks when doing so.
See Invisibility (Su)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:This ability, gained at 6th level, functions like a see invisibility spell, except that it is constantly in effect and it reveals only invisible marks.
Shielded Mind (Su)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 6th level, a bloodhound gains spell resistance against divination spells equal to 15 + his bloodhound level. This benefit does not stack with other forms of spell resistance.
Locate Creature (Sp)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Once per day, a bloodhound of 7th level or higher can produce an effect identical to that of a locate creature spell with a caster level equal to the bloodhound's character level.
Freedom of Movement (Su)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 8th level, a bloodhound can act normally regardless of magical effects that impede movement, as if he were affected by a freedom of movement spell. The effect lasts for a total time per day of 1 round per point of Wisdom bonus he possesses (minimum 1 round). The effect occurs automatically as soon as it is applied, lasts until it runs out or is no longer needed, and can be used multiple times per day (up to the total daily limit of rounds). The character's caster level is equal to his bloodhound level.
Scent (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 9th level, a bloodhound gains the scent ability (see page 314 of the Monster Manual).
Find the Path (Sp)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 10th-level bloodhound can use find the path twice per day as the spell. His caster level is equal to his bloodhound level.


###Block: Daggerspell Mage	
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Daggerspell mages gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Daggercast (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Daggerspell mages seamlessly blend the use of their twin daggers with powerful spellcasting abilities. A daggerspell mage can cast a spell with somatic and material components even when holding a dagger in each hand. If a daggerspell mage holds anything other than a dagger, he must have at least one hand free to cast a spell with somatic or material components. Casting a spell in this way still provokes attacks of opportunity normally. In addition, a daggerspell mage can deliver a touch spell with a dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or a normal melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger).
Invocation of the Knife (Su)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, daggerspell mages develop a strong mystical connection between their arcane spellcasting abilities and the daggers that they wield. Whenever a daggerspell mage casts an arcane spell that deals energy damage, he can turn half of the damage dealt by the spell into magic slashing damage rather than energy damage. Energy resistance does not apply to this damage, but damage reduction might. This power does not affect a creature's ability to resist the affected spell with a saving throw or spell resistance. Using this ability does not require an action; its use is part of the action required to cast the affected spell. Only spells with a duration of instantaneous can be modified by this ability.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a daggerspell mage gains new spells per day at each level (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a daggerspell mage, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Sneak Attack (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a daggerspell mage deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 6th level and 3d6 points at 9th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player's Handbook. If a daggerspell mage gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack.
Double Daggercast (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As a daggerspell mage advances in level, the connection between his spellcasting abilities and his two-dagger fighting style strengthens. At 5th level and higher, a mage can hold the charge for one touch spell for each dagger that he is holding in his hands. He must designate which dagger holds each touch spell at the time the spell is cast. If one of these daggers leaves the daggerspell mage's hands, the spell immediately discharges harmlessly (unless the dagger is thrown by a mage with the arcane throw ability; see below).
Arcane Infusion (Su)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level and higher, a daggerspell mage can infuse arcane spell power into his daggers, temporarily enabling them to deal extra energy damage. To use this ability, a mage must lose a prepared arcane spell from memory (or give up a potential spell slot for the day if he casts spells as a sorcerer). The daggerspell mage chooses one dagger that he is holding and an energy type (fire, cold, or electricity) when this ability is activated. The chosen dagger deals an extra 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the spell level sacrificed. Multiple uses of this ability on the same dagger don't stack, even if different energy types are chosen. If the dagger is thrown, the energy damage applies to that attack, but then the effect immediately dissipates. Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137).



Arcane Throw (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 8th level and higher, a daggerspell mage can imbue arcane spell power into his thrown daggers. The mage can deliver a touch spell with a thrown dagger just as if he were making a melee attack. If the dagger hits, the touch spell is discharged against the creature or object struck. If the dagger misses its intended target, the dagger returns to the mage just before his next turn (as if it had the returning special ability; see page 225 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) and retains the spell just as if the mage had missed with a melee attack.
Daggerspell Flurry (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 10th-level daggerspell mage can blend spellcasting with a flurry of dagger attacks. When using this ability, a daggerspell mage can quicken one spell as part of a full attack with his daggers. Doing this has no effect on the spell's effective level. A daggerspell mage must make at least one melee attack in any round in which he uses this ability, and he cannot make an attack with anything other than a dagger (although if a spell cast in conjunction with this ability requires an attack roll, he can still make the spell's attack). A daggerspell mage can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Dexterity modifier (minimum 1).


###Block: Daggerspell Shaper	
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Daggerspell shapers gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Daggercast (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Daggerspell shapers seamlessly blend the use of their twin daggers with powerful spellcasting abilities. A daggerspell shaper can cast a spell with somatic and material components even when holding a dagger in each hand. If a daggerspell shaper holds anything other than a dagger, she must have at least one hand free to cast a spell with somatic or material components. Casting a spell in this way still provokes attacks of opportunity normally. In addition, a daggerspell shaper can deliver a touch spell with a dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or a normal melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger).
Wild Shape (Su)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A daggerspell shaper can change into a Small or Medium animal and back again, and can do so more often than most other characters with the wild shape ability. See the druid class feature, page 37 of the Player's Handbook. This ability lasts for 1 hour per class level or until she changes back. Levels of the daggerspell shaper prestige class stack with druid levels for the purpose of determining the maximum duration of the wild shape ability; they do not stack for any other purpose (such as the size and type of creature that a shaper can become). A daggerspell shaper gains one additional daily use of her wild shape ability at 1st level, 5th level, and 10th level. At 2nd level, a daggerspell shaper becomes able to use her wild shape ability to take the form of a Tiny animal. At 4th level, she can use wild shape to take the form of a Large animal.




Dagger Claws (Su)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When a daggerspell shaper of 2nd level or higher uses wild shape, she adds any magical properties of daggers that she is holding in each hand into the natural attacks of her new form. The magic of a single dagger affects only the natural attacks made with the corresponding limb in the shaper's animal form, not all her attacks. For example, a 2nd-level daggerspell shaper holding a +1 flaming dagger in one hand and a +2 keen dagger in the other hand transforms into a leopard. The daggers affect the claw attacks of her new form as follows: One gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls and also gains the flaming special ability, and the other gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls and also gains the keen special ability. If the assumed form does not have a claw or slam attack with a limb that corresponds to the druid's natural limbs, this ability has no effect. The bonuses from this ability last for the duration of the wild shape effect. When a shaper uses this ability, her natural weapons in animal form overcome damage reduction exactly as do the daggers that she was holding when she transformed. In the example above, the shaper would be able to overcome a foe's damage reduction as if both of her natural weapons were magic.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a daggerspell shaper gains new spells per day at each level (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If she had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a daggerspell shaper, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Sneak Attack (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a daggerspell shaper deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 6th level and 3d6 points at 9th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player's Handbook. If a daggerspell shaper gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack.
Fast Wild Shape (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 7th level, a daggerspell shaper can use her wild shape ability as a move action rather than as a standard action.
Enhanced Wild Shape (Su)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 8th level, a daggerspell shaper can preserve the physical enhancements granted by her equipment even when in wild shape. Whenever the shaper uses wild shape, she retains any enhancement bonuses to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution granted by any equipment she wears, even if the equipment can't be worn normally by her new form.
Daggerspell Flurry (Ex)	KEY: ~ XXX	SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.XXXClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 10th-level daggerspell shaper can blend spellcasting with a flurry of dagger attacks. When using this ability, the shaper can quicken one spell as part of a full attack with her daggers. Doing this has no effect on the spell's effective level. A daggerspell shaper must make at least one melee attack in any round in which she uses this ability, and she cannot make an attack with anything other than a dagger (although if a spell cast in conjunction with this ability requires an attack roll, she can still make the spell's attack). A daggerspell shaper can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Dexterity bonus (minimum 1).

###Block: Dread Pirate	39
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Dread pirates are proficient with all simple weapons, with light martial weapons, and with the rapier. Dread pirates are proficient with light armor but not with shields.
Seamanship (Ex): A dread pirate adds his class level as an insight bonus on all Profession (sailor) checks. Allies within sight or hearing of a dread pirate add an insight bonus equal to half this number on their Profession (sailor) checks.
Two-Weapon Fighting: A dread pirate wearing light or no armor is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the prerequisites for the feat.
Fearsome Reputation (Ex): By the time he attains 2nd level, a dread pirate has developed a reputation on the high seas. At this point, he must choose whether to cultivate a reputation as an honorable pirate (avoiding undue bloodshed, honoring flags of truce, and the like) or as a dishonorable pirate (favoring mayhem and dire treatment of prisoners). An honorable dread pirate gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks, while a dishonorable one gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks. This bonus increases to +4 at 6th level and to +6 at 10th level. In addition, a dread pirate gains other abilities at higher levels based on his chosen reputation. A dread pirate's actual activities or alignment need not match his reputation. However, a radical shift away from his reputation might negate or even reverse that reputation at the DM's option. Also, a dread pirate in disguise does not gain any effect granted by his reputation (including the special abilities described below that depend on the dread pirate's reputation).
Rally the Crew (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, an honorable dread pirate can inspire his allies (including himself) to great bravery in combat once per day. This inspiration grants them a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. To be affected, an ally must be able to see or hear the dread pirate. The effect requires a free action to activate and lasts for 1 minute per class level, even if the dread pirate moves out of range or loses consciousness. This is a mind-affecting ability. At 7th level, a dread pirate can use this ability twice per day, and the bonus increases to +2. If a dread pirate has the inspire courage bardic music ability, he can add the morale bonus gained from that ability to the morale bonus gained from this ability to determine the total morale bonus granted. For example, an 8th-level bard/3rd-level dread pirate would provide a +3 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls.




40
Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a dishonorable dread pirate deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when fl anking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player's Handbook. The amount of extra damage dealt increases to 2d6 at 7th level. If a dishonorable dread pirate gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack.
Acrobatic Charge (Ex): A dread pirate of 4th level or higher can charge over diffi cult terrain that normally slows movement or through the squares occupied by allies blocking his path. This ability enables him to charge across a cluttered ship's deck, leap down from a higher deck, or swing between two adjacent ships to get to his target. Depending on the circumstances, he might still need to make appropriate checks (such as Jump, Tumble, or Use Rope checks) to successfully move over the terrain.
Steady Stance (Ex): At 4th level and higher, a dread pirate remains stable on his feet when others have difficulty standing. He is not considered flat-footed while balancing or climbing, and he adds his class level as a bonus on Balance or Climb checks to remain balancing or climbing when he takes damage.
Luck of the Wind (Ex): Once per day, an honorable dread pirate of 5th level or higher can reroll any failed attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw. He must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll.
Scourge of the Seas (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a dishonorable dread pirate can instill fear into his enemies. When the character uses Intimidate to demoralize foes, the attempt affects all enemies within 30 feet who can see and hear him, and the effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Charisma modifi er (minimum 1 round). Multiple uses of this ability don't stack. This is a mind-affecting ability.
Skill Mastery (Ex): At 8th level, a dread pirate becomes supremely confi dent of his mobility. He has mastered the skills Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble to the extent that he can take 10 with them even under stress.
Fight to the Death (Ex): At 9th level and higher, an honorable dread pirate can inspire his allies to carry on against tremendous odds. Each ally affected by the dread pirate's rally the crew ability (see above) also gains temporary hit points equal to 10 + the dread pirate's Cha bonus (minimum 10), gains a dodge bonus to Armor Class equal to the dread pirate's Cha bonus (minimum +1), and is treated as having the Diehard feat even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites. These effects are lost if the dread pirate loses consciousness.
Motivate the Scum (Ex): Once per day, a dishonorable dread pirate of 9th level or higher can motivate his allies by killing a helpless individual. All allies of the dread pirate who see the act gain a +2 morale bonus on damage rolls. This effect lasts for 24 hours. Most dishonorable dread pirates don't care whether the victim is a prisoner or one of their own crew. In fact, if the slain individual is one of the dread pirate's crew, the morale bonus on damage rolls improves to +4, but the allies also take a -2 penalty on Will saves for the duration of the effect.



41

Pirate King (Ex): A 10th-level dread pirate's exploits have become so legendary that great numbers of able sailors are willing to sign on as his crew for no compensation other than a share of the booty. Treat this ability as the equivalent of the Leadership feat, except that only followers (and no cohorts) are gained.

###Block: Dungeon Delver 43
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Dungeon delvers gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Darkvision (Ex): A dungeon delver's long exposure to pitch-black subterranean surroundings enables him to develop darkvision out to 60 feet. If the character already has darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet.
Deep Survival (Ex): A dungeon delver's experience in deep, dark places grants him a great familiarity with that world. He adds his class level to Survival checks made in underground environments.
Trap Sense (Ex): A dungeon delver is adept at evading the effects of traps. See the barbarian class feature, page 26 of the Player's Handbook. The bonuses rise by 1 for every three additional dungeon delver levels gained (+2 at 4th level, +3 at 7th level, and +4 at 10th level) and stack with similar bonuses granted by other classes.
Reduce (Sp): A dungeon delver frequently finds it necessary to squeeze through narrow crevices, half-collapsed passages, prison bars, and other tight spots that would normally block a character of his size and bulk. Starting at 2nd level, a dungeon delver can use reduce person on himself three times per day (regardless of his creature type). His caster level is equal to his class level.
Stonecunning (Ex): At 2nd level, a dungeon delver gains the stonecunning ability. This functions exactly as the dwarf racial trait of the same name (see page 15 of the Player's Handbook), except that the check modifiers are competence bonuses rather than racial bonuses. If a dungeon delver already has stonecunning because of his race, both sets of bonuses apply.
Augury (Sp): Beginning at 3rd level, a dungeon delver can foretell whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for him in the immediate future. Once per day, he can use augury as a free action; his caster level is equal to his class level. He can use this ability one additional time per day for every three additional class levels gained (2/day at 6th level and 3/day at 9th level).
Skill Mastery (Ex): At 3rd level, a dungeon delver becomes so confident in the use of certain skills that he can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. The character selects a number of skills equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the Player's Handbook.
Evasion (Ex): Beginning at 4th level, a dungeon delver can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful Reflex save. See the monk class feature, page 41 of the Player's Handbook. If a dungeon delver already has evasion, he gains improved evasion instead, allowing him to avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful Reflex save and take only half damage on a failed save. See the monk class feature, page 42 of the Player's Handbook.
Blindsense (Ex): At 5th level, a dungeon delver gains the ability to activate an acute sensitivity to sounds, smells, movement, and other disturbances within 30 feet. This functions as described on page 306 of the Monster Manual and lasts for 1 minute per class level. A dungeon delver can use blindsense once per day at 5th level and twice per day at 10th level.
Passwall (Sp): Starting at 6th level, a dungeon delver can use passwall once per day as a caster of his class level. This ability comes in handy for bypassing small cave-ins or sneaking into vaults.
Find the Path (Sp): Starting at 8th level, a dungeon delver can use find the path twice per day as a caster of his class level. Typically, a delver uses this to find his way into and out of confounding mazes and dungeons. He can target only himself with the ability.
Phase Door (Sp): At 9th level, a dungeon delver gains the ability to use phase door once per day as an 18th-level caster. This ability enables him to bypass cave-ins, walk through dead ends and immovable obstructions, and make quick escapes through walls.

###Block: Exemplars  45
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Exemplars gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Skill Artistry (Ex): An exemplar is particularly talented in the use of one of her skills. Choose one skill in which the exemplar has at least 13 ranks. She gains a +4 competence bonus on all checks involving that skill. At 4th, 7th, and 10th levels, an exemplar gains this ability again. Each time she selects a different skill to receive the +4 competence bonus, provided she has at least 13 ranks in a skill that she has not yet chosen to benefit from this ability. If not, she gains no benefit from the ability until she has 13 ranks in another skill. She can then immediately apply the benefit of skill artistry to that skill.
Skill Mastery (Ex): An exemplar is so confident in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. She selects a number of skills equal to 1 + her Int modifier. When making a check with one of these skills, she can take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. Each time an exemplar gains a class level, she can add another skill to the list of skills with which she has mastery.


46
Lend Talent (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, an exemplar can lend some of her skill artistry to allies, allowing them to exceed their normal talents. By accepting a penalty on checks using a skill for which she has selected skill artistry, an exemplar grants a competence bonus on checks with that skill to all allies within 30 feet. The penalty can be any number that does not exceed the exemplar's class level, and the competence bonus is equal to one-half the penalty. Activating this ability is a full-round action, and the effect lasts for as long as the exemplar remains conscious and within range. For example, a 4th-level exemplar who has selected skill artistry with Craft (armorsmithing) can accept a -4 penalty on Craft (armorsmithing) checks to grant all allies within 30 feet a +2 competence bonus on Craft (armorsmithing) checks for as long as she remains nearby. At 8th level, the competence bonus granted by this ability becomes equal to the penalty accepted by the exemplar.
Bonus Feat: At 3rd, 6th, and 9th levels, an exemplar gains a bonus feat, which must be selected from the following list: Acrobatic, Agile, Alertness, Animal Affinity, Athletic, Blind-Fight, Combat Casting, Combat Expertise, Deceitful, Deft Hands, Diligent, Improved Initiative, Improved Swimming?, Investigator, Magical Aptitude, Negotiator, Nimble Fingers, Open Minded?, Persuasive, Self-Sufficient, Skill Focus, Stealthy, Track, or Versatile Performer?. The exemplar must meet all the prerequisites for the chosen feat. ? New feat described in Chapter 3.
Sustaining Presence (Su): Starting at 4th level, an exemplar knows how to call upon her force of personality to help keep herself alive in tense or dangerous situations. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her Concentration checks and Fortitude saves.
Persuasive Performance (Ex): Starting at 5th level, an exemplar can use her skill artistry to improve the attitudes of NPCs. To do this, the NPCs must observe her using one of the skills to which she has applied skill artistry. Treat this as a Diplomacy check made to influence NPC attitudes (see pages 71-72 of the Player's Handbook), but replace the Diplomacy check with a check using the chosen skill. The demonstration must be nonthreatening and intended to entertain and amuse the onlookers. Viewers must be within 30 feet of the exemplar, must be able to see her clearly, and must willingly pay attention to her actions. This ability requires at least 1 minute to perform, and it can affect a particular creature only once every 24 hours.
Intellectual Agility (Su): Starting at 8th level, an exemplar can channel her intellect to more physical needs. She adds her Intelligence bonus (if any) to her initiative checks and Reflex saves.
Perfect Self: A 10th-level exemplar has tuned her body with skill to the point that she becomes a magical creature. Her type changes to outsider (native). See the monk class feature, page 42 of the Player's Handbook.
