###Block: Animal Lord
SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Animal lords gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Animal Bond (Ex): An animal lord develops a bond with animals of his selected group (see below). He gains a +4 bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy checks made to influence animals from his chosen group. If an animal lord has the animal companion class feature, he adds his animal lord level to his effective druid level for the purpose of determining his animal companion's bonus Hit Dice, special abilities, and so forth. The eight groups of animals included here, along with examples taken from the Monster Manual, are as follows.
	DESC:Apelord: ape, baboon, dire ape, monkey.
	DESC:Bearlord: black bear, brown bear, dire bear, polar bear.
	DESC:Birdlord: eagle, giant eagle*, giant owl*, hawk, owl, raven.
	DESC:Catlord: cat, cheetah, dire lion, dire tiger, leopard, lion, tiger.
	DESC:Horselord: horse (all), pony, warpony.
	DESC:Sharklord: dire shark, shark (all).
	DESC:Snakelord: constrictor, giant constrictor, viper (all).
	DESC:Wolflord: dire wolf, wolf.
Detect Animals (Sp): Beginning at 1st level, an animal lord can detect the presence of any animals of his selected group at will, as if using detect animals or plants with a caster level equal to his class level.
Wild Empathy (Ex): An animal lord can improve the attitude of an animal. See the druid class feature, page 35 of the Player's Handbook. If an animal lord has wild empathy from another class, his levels stack for determining the bonus.
First Totem: At 2nd level, an animal lord gains a +4 bonus on checks made with a specific skill, determined by his selected group as follows. Apelord: Climb; Bearlord: Intimidate; Birdlord: Spot; Catlord: Move Silently; Horselord: Jump; Sharklord: Swim; Snakelord: Escape Artist; Wolflord: Survival.
Low-Light Vision (Ex): At 2nd level, an animal lord gains low-light vision, allowing him to see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of shadowy illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions. If an animal lord already has low-light vision from another source (such as his race), his low-light vision improves, allowing him to see three times as far as a human in conditions of shadowy illumination.



SOURCEPAGE:p.24


Wild Aspect (Su): At 3rd level and higher, an animal lord can take on an aspect of the animals of his selected group. Assuming a wild aspect is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137). Unless otherwise noted, the effect lasts for 1 minute per level. An animal lord can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels gained after 3rd (twice per day at 6th level and three times per day at 9th level). When an animal lord reaches 7th level, his wild aspect becomes more powerful, as described below. If an animal lord has the wild shape ability, he can spend one daily use of wild shape to assume his wild aspect instead (the duration is as normal for the wild aspect). If an animal lord already has a natural attack of the type gained by his wild aspect, use whichever damage figure is superior while the wild aspect is active. If an animal lord wields a weapon while using his wild aspect, he can use the natural attacks gained as natural secondary weapons if he uses his weapon as a primary attack, provided they are still available (an apelord couldn't use a secondary claw attack, for example, if he wields a twohanded weapon).
	DESC:Apelord: An apelord gains two primary claw attacks. Each claw deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for Small apelords). If an apelord hits an opponent with both claw attacks, he rends the foe for an additional 2d4 points of damage (or 2d3 points for Small apelords), plus 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus. At 7th level, the claw damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small apelords) and the rend damage to 2d6 points (or 2d4 points for Small apelords).
	DESC:Bearlord: A bearlord gains two primary claw attacks. Each claw deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for Small bearlords). If a bearlord hits with a claw attack, he can attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The bearlord still follows all the other normal grappling rules. At 7th level, the claw damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small bearlords).
	DESC:Birdlord: A birdlord grows feathery wings, allowing him to fly at his base land speed (average maneuverability). At 7th level, the duration increases to 10 minutes per level.
	DESC:Catlord: A catlord gains two primary claw attacks. Each claw deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for Small catlords). If a catlord charges, he can attack with both claws at the end of his charge. At 7th level, the claw damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small catlords).
	DESC:Horselord: A horselord's speed, as well as the speed of any horse upon which he rides, improves by 10 feet for a duration of 1 hour per level. At 7th level, the speed increase improves to 20 feet.
	DESC:Sharklord: A sharklord gains a devastating bite as a primary natural attack. The bite deals 1d8 points of damage (or 1d6 points for Small sharklords). A sharklord also gains the ability to breathe water while his wild aspect is active. At 7th level, the bite damage increases to 2d6 points (or 1d8 points for Small sharklords).
	DESC:Snakelord: A snakelord gains a poisonous bite as a primary natural attack for 1 round per level. This bite deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for Small snakelords). The poison's Fortitude save DC is 10 + animal lord level + Con modifier, and it deals initial and secondary damage of 1d3 points of Constitution. At 7th level, the bite damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small snakelords), and the initial and secondary poison damage increases to 1d4 points of Constitution.
	DESC:Wolflord: A wolflord gains the scent ability (see page 314 of the Monster Manual) for 10 minutes per level. At 7th level, the duration increases to 1 hour per level.
Speak with Animals (Sp): Beginning at 4th level, an animal lord can use speak with animals (as the spell) once per day to converse with animals of his selected group.

Summon Animal (Sp): Beginning at 5th level, an animal lord can summon one or more animals of his selected group once per day. This ability functions identically to summon nature's ally V, except that an animal lord can summon creatures only from his selected group, as detailed below. The duration of the effect is 1 minute per class level.
	DESC:Apelord: 1d3 dire apes or 1d4+1 apes.
	DESC:Bearlord: 1 polar bear, 1d3 brown bears, or 1d4+1 black bears.
	DESC:Birdlord: 1d4+1 eagles, [giant eagles, giant owls1 - May be summoned only by nonevil birdlords.], hawks, ravens, or owls.
	DESC:Catlord: 1 dire lion, 1d3 tigers, or 1d4+1 lions.
	DESC:Horselord: 1d4+1 heavy horses, heavy warhorses, light horses, light warhorses, ponies, or warponies.
	DESC:Sharklord: 1d3 Huge sharks or 1d4+1 Large sharks [May be summoned only into an aquatic or watery environment.].
	DESC:Snakelord: 1 giant constrictor snake, 1d3 Huge vipers, or 1d4+1 constrictor snakes or Large vipers.
	DESC:Wolflord: 1d4+1 dire wolves or wolves.

SOURCEPAGE:p.25

Second Totem: At 6th level, an animal lord gains a bonus feat related to his selected group, even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites. If the animal lord already has the feat, he can choose any other feat for which he meets the prerequisites. Apelord: Brachiation?; Bearlord: Improved Grapple; Birdlord: Flyby Attack (see page 303 of the Monster Manual); Catlord: Lightning Reflexes; Horselord: Trample; Sharklord: Improved Critical (bite); Snakelord: Improved Initiative; Wolflord: Improved Trip. ?New feat described on page 106.
Animal Growth (Sp): Once per day, an animal lord of 7th level or higher can use animal growth on a single animal from his selected group as a swift action (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137) as a spellcaster of his class level. This ability otherwise functions just like the spell.
Animal Telepathy (Su): Beginning at 8th level, an animal lord can converse telepathically with any animal of his selected group that he can see within 100 feet.
Third Totem: At 10th level, an animal lord gains a permanent 2-point increase to one of his ability scores, determined by his chosen animal group as follows. Apelord: +2 Strength; Bearlord: +2 Constitution; Birdlord: +2 Wisdom; Catlord: +2 Dexterity; Horselord: +2 Constitution; Sharklord: +2 Strength; Snakelord: +2 Charisma; Wolflord: +2 Strength.

Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Beastmasters gain
no profi ciency with any weapon or armor.
Animal Companion (Ex): A beastmaster gains the
service of a loyal animal companion. See the druid
class feature, pages 35-36 of the Player's Handbook. Treat
the beastmaster as a druid whose level is equal to the
beastmaster's class level + 3. A beastmaster can select one
of the animals available to a 1st-level druid and then apply
the modifi cations as appropriate for a 4th-level druid's
animal companion, or she can select a typical version of
one of the animals available to a 4th-level druid.
As a beastmaster gains class levels, her animal companion
gains Hit Dice and other special abilities just as
a druid's animal companion does. Use the beastmaster's
class level + 3 to determine the animal companion's
special abilities.
If a beastmaster already has an animal companion from
another class, her beastmaster class levels stack with
class levels from all other classes that grant an animal
companion. For example, a 5th-level druid/2nd-level
beastmaster would be treated as a 10th-level druid
for the purpose of improving the statistics of her
animal companion (and which alternative
animal companions she could select).
Wild Empathy (Ex): A beastmaster
can improve the attitude
of an animal. See the druid
class feature, page 35 of
the Player's Handbook. If
a beastmaster has wild
empathy from another
class, her levels stack
for determining the
bonus.
Alertness: A beastmaster's
senses grow keen as she learns some of the tricks of the animal kingdom. Accordingly,
she gains Alertness as a bonus feat at 2nd level.

27

Speak with Animals (Sp): Starting at 3rd level, a
beastmaster can use speak with animals once per day as
the spell cast by a caster of her class level. She can use
this ability twice per day at 6th level and three times per
day at 9th level.
Extra Animal Companion (Ex): At 4th level, a
beastmaster gains a second animal companion, chosen
from the list of animal companions available to a 1st-level
druid. Treat the beastmaster as a druid whose level is
equal to the beastmaster's class level - 3 for the purpose
of improving the animal companion's statistics (or of
selecting an alternative companion at higher levels).
At 7th level, a beastmaster gains a third animal companion,
chosen from the list of animal companions
available to a 1st-level druid. Treat the beastmaster as a
druid whose level is equal to the beastmaster's class level
- 6 for the purpose of improving the animal companion's
statistics (or of selecting an alternative companion at
higher levels).
At 10th level, a beastmaster gains a fourth animal
companion, chosen from the list of animal companions
available to a 1st-level druid. Treat the beastmaster as a
druid whose level is equal to the beastmaster's class level
- 9 for the purpose of improving the animal companion's
statistics (or of selecting an alternative companion at
higher levels).
Other class levels in classes that offer an animal companion
don't stack for the purpose of determining the
power of a beastmaster's additional animal companions,
nor do they allow her to choose additional animal companions
from the alternative lists.
Low-Light Vision (Ex): At 5th level, a beastmaster
gains low-light vision, allowing her to see twice as far as
a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar
conditions of shadowy illumination. She retains the ability
to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
If she already has low-light vision from another source
(such as her race), her low-light vision improves, allowing
her to see three times as far as a human in conditions of
shadowy illumination.
Scent (Ex): At 8th level, a beastmaster gains the scent
ability (see page 314 of the Monster Manual).


###Block: Bloodhound	29
Weapon and Armor Profi ciency: Bloodhounds are
profi cient with all simple and martial weapons, and with
light armor.
Mark (Ex): A bloodhound can target, or mark, an individual
humanoid or monstrous humanoid foe to better
hunt that enemy. To do so, the bloodhound must focus
on a foe who is present and visible, or on the depiction or
description of one who is not, for 10 minutes. Any interruption
ruins the attempt and forces the bloodhound to
start the process again. Once this study is complete, that
target is called a mark.
A bloodhound adds his bloodhound level as an insight
bonus on all Gather Information, Listen, Search, Spot, and
Survival checks made to determine the whereabouts of a
mark. As a bloodhound gains levels, he gains additional
abilities that can be used against a mark.
If a bloodhound chooses a new mark before apprehending
an existing one, the latter becomes unmarked, and the
bloodhound loses experience points equal to the amount
he would have earned for defeating that creature. A
bloodhound can choose a mark only once a week.
Initially, a bloodhound can have only one
mark at a time. For every three bloodhound
levels gained beyond 1st, a bloodhound
can have one additional mark, but only
if all the marks are chosen during the
same process (see above). For example,
a 4th-level bloodhound could mark two
bugbears in the same group of prisoners,
or the depictions of a bugbear and
a hobgoblin if both were studied at
the same time. If a bloodhound
gives up on apprehending any of
his marks, all remaining marked
creatures become unmarked as
described above.
Swift Tracker (Ex): A bloodhound
can move at his normal
speed while following tracks. See
the ranger class feature, page 48 of
the Player's Handbook.
Nonlethal Force
(Ex): Starting at 2nd
level, a bloodhound
can use a melee weapon that
deals lethal damage to deal
nonlethal damage instead
without taking the usual
-4 penalty on his attack
roll.
Ready and Waiting (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, a
bloodhound is ready for trickery at all times. He can
ready an action against his mark, even outside of the
initiative sequence. If the mark triggers the bloodhound's
readied action at any point within the next 10 minutes,
the bloodhound can carry out his readied action as if the
two were engaged in combat (as long as the bloodhound
is capable of carrying out that action). If the bloodhound
is incapable of carrying out the action-for instance, if
he is too far away to strike the mark with a readied melee
attack-the readied action is lost.
Bring 'em Back Alive (Ex): At 3rd level and higher, a
bloodhound can turn a potentially killing blow into an
incapacitating one-all the better to bring a mark back
for punishment. At the bloodhound's option, any melee
attack that would reduce a foe to -2 or fewer hit points
reduces the foe to -1 hit points instead. A bloodhound
must choose to use this ability immediately upon reducing
his foe to -2 or fewer hit points, and before making
any other action (or even continuing a full
attack). A raging bloodhound can't use this
ability.
Tenacious Pursuit (Ex): At 3rd level
and above, a bloodhound tracking a
mark gains a +4 bonus on Constitution
checks made to resist nonlethal damage
from a forced march (see page 164 of
the Player's Handbook).
In addition, a bloodhound
tracking a mark
can increase his own
speed by 10 feet, up to
a maximum value equal to
the mark's speed. This bonus
stacks with all other speed
increases. At 6th level, the speed
increase improves to 20 feet, and
it goes up to 30 feet at 9th level.
Hunter's Dedication (Ex):
Beginning at 4th level, a bloodhound
adds his Constitution bonus
(if any) to Will saves made to resist
the special attacks or spells of his
mark.
Move Like the Wind
(Ex): Starting at 4th level,
a bloodhound can move
stealthily even at a quick
pace. He no longer
takes a -5 penalty on Hide and Move Silently checks when moving at any
speed up to his normal speed, and he takes only a -10
penalty (instead of a -20 penalty) on Hide and Move Silently
checks when running. (He takes the normal -20
penalty when attacking or charging.)

30

Crippling Strike (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a bloodhound
can deliver strikes against his mark with such
precision that each successful attack also deals 2 points of
Strength damage to the mark. A bloodhound can deliver
a crippling strike with a melee attack, or with a ranged
attack from a distance of up to 30 feet. See the rogue class
feature, page 51 of the Player's Handbook.
Track the Trackless (Su): Starting at 5th level, a
bloodhound can track a creature moving under the
influence of pass without trace or a similar effect, though
he takes a -20 penalty on his Survival checks when
doing so.
See Invisibility (Su): This ability, gained at 6th
level, functions like a see invisibility spell, except that
it is constantly in effect and it reveals only invisible
marks.
Shielded Mind (Su): At 6th level, a bloodhound gains
spell resistance against divination spells equal to 15 + his
bloodhound level. This benefit does not stack with other
forms of spell resistance.
Locate Creature (Sp): Once per day, a bloodhound
of 7th level or higher can produce an effect identical to
that of a locate creature spell with a caster level equal to
the bloodhound's character level.
Freedom of Movement (Su): Starting at 8th level,
a bloodhound can act normally regardless of magical
effects that impede movement, as if he were affected
by a freedom of movement spell. The effect lasts for a total
time per day of 1 round per point of Wisdom bonus he
possesses (minimum 1 round). The effect occurs automatically
as soon as it is applied, lasts until it runs out or
is no longer needed, and can be used multiple times per
day (up to the total daily limit of rounds). The character's
caster level is equal to his bloodhound level.
Scent (Ex): At 9th level, a bloodhound gains the scent
ability (see page 314 of the Monster Manual).
Find the Path (Sp): A 10th-level bloodhound can use
find the path twice per day as the spell. His caster level is
equal to his bloodhound level.


###Block: Daggerspell Mage	32
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Daggerspell mages
gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Daggercast (Ex): Daggerspell mages seamlessly blend
the use of their twin daggers with powerful spellcasting
abilities. A daggerspell mage can cast a spell with somatic
and material components even when holding a dagger in
each hand. If a daggerspell mage holds anything other than
a dagger, he must have at least one hand free to cast a spell
with somatic or material components. Casting a spell in
this way still provokes attacks of opportunity normally.
In addition, a daggerspell mage can deliver a touch
spell with a dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or
a normal melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger).
Invocation of the Knife (Su): Beginning at 2nd level,
daggerspell mages develop a strong mystical connection
between their arcane spellcasting abilities and the daggers
that they wield. Whenever a daggerspell mage casts an
arcane spell that deals energy damage, he can turn half of
the damage dealt by the spell into magic slashing damage
rather than energy damage. Energy resistance does not
apply to this damage, but damage reduction might. This
power does not affect a creature's ability to resist the
affected spell with a saving throw or spell resistance.
Using this ability does not require an action; its use is
part of the action required to cast the affected spell. Only
spells with a duration of instantaneous can be modified
by this ability.
Spells per Day/Spells Known: Beginning at 2nd level,
a daggerspell mage gains new spells per day at each level
(and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a
level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged
before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however,
gain any other benefit a character of that class would have
gained. If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class
before becoming a daggerspell mage, he must decide to
which class to add each level for the purpose of determining
spells per day and spells known.
Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a daggerspell
mage deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when
flanking an opponent or at any time when the target
would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage
applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30
feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 6th level and 3d6 points
at 9th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the
Player's Handbook. If a daggerspell mage gets a sneak attack
bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the
bonuses on damage stack.
Double Daggercast (Ex): As a daggerspell mage advances
in level, the connection between his spellcasting
abilities and his two-dagger fighting style strengthens.
At 5th level and higher, a mage can hold the charge for
one touch spell for each dagger that he is holding in his
hands. He must designate which dagger holds each touch
spell at the time the spell is cast. If one of these daggers
leaves the daggerspell mage's hands, the spell immediately
discharges harmlessly (unless the dagger is thrown
by a mage with the arcane throw ability; see below).
Arcane Infusion (Su): At 7th level and higher, a
daggerspell mage can infuse arcane spell power into his
daggers, temporarily enabling them to deal extra energy
damage. To use this ability, a mage must lose a prepared
arcane spell from memory (or give up a potential spell
slot for the day if he casts spells as a sorcerer). The daggerspell
mage chooses one dagger that he is holding and
an energy type (fire, cold, or electricity) when this ability
is activated. The chosen dagger deals an extra 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. This effect lasts for
a number of rounds equal to the spell level sacrificed.
Multiple uses of this ability on the same dagger don't
stack, even if different energy types are chosen. If the
dagger is thrown, the energy damage applies to that
attack, but then the effect immediately dissipates.
Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke
attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions and Immediate
Actions, page 137).

33

Arcane Throw (Ex): At 8th level and higher, a daggerspell
mage can imbue arcane spell power into his
thrown daggers. The mage can deliver a touch spell with
a thrown dagger just as if he were making a melee attack.
If the dagger hits, the touch spell is discharged against the
creature or object struck. If the dagger misses its intended
target, the dagger returns to the mage just before his next
turn (as if it had the returning special ability; see page
225 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) and retains the spell
just as if the mage had missed with a melee attack.
Daggerspell Flurry (Ex): A 10th-level daggerspell
mage can blend spellcasting with a flurry of dagger attacks.
When using this ability, a daggerspell mage can quicken
one spell as part of a full attack with his daggers. Doing
this has no effect on the spell's effective level. A daggerspell
mage must make at least one melee attack in any
round in which he uses this ability, and he cannot make
an attack with anything other than a dagger (although if
a spell cast in conjunction with this ability requires an
attack roll, he can still make the spell's attack).
A daggerspell mage can use this ability a number of times
per day equal to his Dexterity modifier (minimum 1).


###Block: Daggerspell Shaper	36
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Daggerspell
shapers gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Daggercast (Ex): Daggerspell shapers seamlessly blend
the use of their twin daggers with powerful spellcasting
abilities. A daggerspell shaper can cast a spell with somatic
and material components even when holding a dagger in
each hand. If a daggerspell shaper holds anything other
than a dagger, she must have at least one hand free to cast
a spell with somatic or material components. Casting a
spell in this way still provokes attacks of opportunity
normally.
In addition, a daggerspell shaper can deliver a touch
spell with a dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or
a normal melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger).
Wild Shape (Su): A daggerspell shaper can change into
a Small or Medium animal and back again, and can do so
more often than most other characters with the wild shape
