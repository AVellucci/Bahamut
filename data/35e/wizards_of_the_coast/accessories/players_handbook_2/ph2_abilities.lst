Spells				KEY:Beguiler ~ Spells					SOURCEPAGE:p.6	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.BeguilerClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:A beguiler casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the beguiler spell list on page 11. When you gain access to a new level of spells, you automatically know all the spells for that level on the beguiler's spell list. You can cast any spell you know without preparing it ahead of time. Essentially, your spell list is the same as your spells known list. You also have the option of adding to your existing spell list through your advanced learning class feature (see below) as you increase in level. To cast a beguiler spell, you must have an Intelligence score of 10 + the spell's level (Int 10 for 0-level spells, Int 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a beguiler's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the beguiler's Int modifier. Like other spellcasters, a beguiler can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. The base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-1. In addition, you receive bonus spells for a high Intelligence score (PH 8). A beguiler need not prepare spells in advance. You can cast any spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your spells per day for that spell level.
Armored Mage			KEY:Beguiler ~ Armored Mage				SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.BeguilerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Normally, armor of any type interferes with an arcane spellcaster's gestures, which can cause your spells to fail if those spells have a somatic component. A beguiler's limited focus and specialized training, however, allow you to avoid any chance of arcane spell failure as long as you restrict yourself to light armor. This training does not extend to any other form of armor, nor does this ability apply to spells gained from other spellcasting classes.
Trapfinding				KEY:Beguiler ~ Trapfinding				SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.BeguilerClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Beguilers can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. Beguilers can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap typically has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. A beguiler who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with his allies) without disarming it.
Cloaked Casting			KEY:Beguiler ~ Cloaked Casting			SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.BeguilerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a beguiler's spells become more effective when cast against an unwary foe. You gain a +1 bonus to the spell's save DC when you cast a spell that targets any foe who would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not). At 8th level, you gain a +2 bonus on rolls made to overcome the spell resistance of any affected target. At 14th level, the bonus to your spell's save DC increases to +2. At 20th level, you become able to automatically overcome the spell resistance of any affected target.		DEFINE:CloakedCastingLVL|0
Surprise Casting			KEY:Beguiler ~ Surprise Casting			SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.BeguilerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, when you successfully use the Bluff skill to feint in combat, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus (if it has one) to AC for the next melee attack you make against it or the next spell you cast. You must remain in melee with the target, and the attack must be made or the spell cast on or before your next turn. The target is not considered fl at-footed and therefore can make attacks of opportunity against you if you do not cast defensively. At 6th level, you gain the ability to feint in combat as a move action instead of a standard action. If you have the Improved Feint feat, you can now feint in combat as a swift action.		DEFINE:SurpriseCastingLVL|0
Advanced Learning			KEY:Beguiler ~ Advanced Learning			SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.BeguilerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level, you can add a new spell to your list, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a sorcerer/ wizard spell of the enchantment or illusion school and of a level no higher than that of the highest-level spell you already know. Once a new spell is selected, it is forever added to your spell list and can be cast just like any other spell on your list. You gain another new spell at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level.

Silent Spell			KEY:Beguiler ~ Silent Spell				SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.BeguilerClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 5th level, you gain Silent Spell as a bonus feat.	AUTO:FEAT|Silent Spell
Still Spell				KEY:Beguiler ~ Still Spell				SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.BeguilerClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 10th level, you gain Still Spell as a bonus feat.	AUTO:FEAT|Still Spell
