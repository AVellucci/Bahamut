###Block: Traits
# Ability Name				Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type											Combat bonus					Wield Category bonus		Source Page		Description of the Benefits
Powerful Build				KEY:Powerful Build ~ Goliath		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RaceTrait.GoliathRaceTrait	BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT.GRAPPLE|4|PRESIZELT:C	BONUS:WIELDCATEGORY|ALL|-1	SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:The physical stature of a goliath let's him function in many ways as if he were one size category larger. Whenever a goliath is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the goliath is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A goliath is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature's special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A goliath can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject's size category.
Mountain Movement				KEY:Mountain Movement ~ Goliath	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RaceTrait.GoliathRaceTrait													SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:Because goliaths practically live on the ledges and cliffs of the most forbidding mountains, they are particularly adept at negotiating mountain hazards. Goliaths can make standing long jumps and high Jumps as if they were running long jumps and high Jumps. A goliath can engage in accelerated climbing (climbing half his speed as a move action) without taking the -5 penalty on the Climb check.
Acclimated					KEY:Acclimated ~ Goliath		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RaceTrait.GoliathRaceTrait													SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:Goliaths are automatically acclimated to life at high altitude. They don't take the penalties for altitude described in the Mountian Travel section on page 90 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Unlike other denizens of the mountains, goliaths don't lose their acclimation to high altitude even if they spend a long time at a lower elevation.
+2 bonus on Sense Motive checks	KEY:Racial Bonus ~ Goliath		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RaceTrait.GoliathRaceTrait													SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:When speaking to one another, goliaths tend to augment their verbal communication wl1h subtle body language. They are likewise able to read the unintentional body language of others.
