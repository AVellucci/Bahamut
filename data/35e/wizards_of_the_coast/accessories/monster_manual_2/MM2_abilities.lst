Race Traits ~ Asperi	CATEGORY:Internal	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=AsperiRaceTrait
Dodge Arrows (Ex)		KEY:Dodge Arrows ~ Asperi	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.AsperiRaceTrait.SpecialQuality			DESC:A flying asperi gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against any missile attack during any turn in which it takes a move action. If it has a rider, he or she also gains the bonus. The bonus lasts until the asperi's next turn.
Feather Fall (Sp)		KEY:Feather Fall ~ Asperi	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.AsperiRaceTrait.SpecialQuality			DESC:An asperi can use feather fall up to four times per day. Caster level 4th.
Ride the Wind (Su)	KEY:Ride the Wind ~ Asperi	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.AsperiRaceTrait.SpecialQuality			DESC:This ability is similar to the effect of the air walk spell in most respects. When an asperi uses ride the wind, it gains bonus movement (+1 ft. to fly speed for each 1 mph of the prevailing wind) when moving with winds faster than 20 mph. Adverse winds do not slow the creature down, but they provide no bonus movement. An asperi carrying a rider gallops through the air so smoothly that the rider can cast spells without making Concentration checks, provided that the asperi does not attack or perform any sudden aerial maneuvers.
Telepathy (Su)		KEY:Telepathy ~ Asperi		SOURCEPAGE:p.26	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.AsperiRaceTrait.SpecialQuality			DESC:An asperi can communicate with any creature that has an Intelligence score of at least 1 through a form of telepathy. This communication has a range of 60 feet, and its complexity is limited by the Intelligence score of the other creature.
Uncanny Dodge (Ex)	KEY:Uncanny Dodge ~ Asperi	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.AsperiRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.UncannyDodge	DESC:Because of its preternatural alertness, an asperi retains its Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed, and it cannot be flanked.
Wind Immunity (Ex)	KEY:Wind Immunity ~ Asperi	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.AsperiRaceTrait.SpecialQuality			DESC:Winds, either natural or magical, have no effect on an asperi unless it chooses to ride them for additional movement (see Ride the Wind, above). This benefit applies equally to mountain gales, magical windstorms, elemental whirlwinds, and other similar effects.
