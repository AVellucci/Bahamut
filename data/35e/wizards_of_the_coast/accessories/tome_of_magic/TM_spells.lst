	SCHOOL:Illusion
	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting|Shadow
	RANGE:Medium
	TARGETAREA:One living creature
	DURATION:Instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:Will half
	SPELLRES:Yes
	DESC:A shadowy image of your foe appears before him and reaches out to clutch him before vanishing. You draw forth a twisted refl ection of your foe from the Plane of Shadow. The image unerringly touches the subject, causing Wisdom damage equal to 1d6 points +1 point per four caster levels (maximum +5). A Will saving throw halves the Wisdom damage.
Army of Shadow

	TARGETAREA:One or more summoned creatures, no two of which are more than 30 ft. apart
	DURATION:1 minute/ level (D)
	SAVEINFO:None
	SPELLRES:No
	DESC:Reality seems to tear open, revealing a dark rift. From the blackness, a shadow elemental emerges. The fi rst of many, it is ready to serve. This mystery functions like the spell summon monster I, except as noted here. You can summon one elder, two greater, four Huge, or eight Large shadow elementals.

	SPELLRES:No
	DESC:A bolt of shadow springs from your hand, draining vitality where it strikes. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to deal 2d4 points of nonlethal damage to the target. If you score a critical hit, triple the damage.
Aura Of Shade
	SOURCEPAGE:p.142
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Elemental Shadows=4
	SCHOOL:Abjuration
	DESCRIPTOR:Cold
	RANGE:Touch
	TARGETAREA:Creature touched
	DURATION:1 round/level (D)
	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)
	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)
	DESC:The environment grows immediately more comfortable as you surround yourself with an aura of protective shadow. You protect the subject from low temperatures and cold energy with a thin layer of that energy's shadowy refl ection. This grants the subject immunity to normal extremes of temperature and absorbs cold damage from attacks and effects. When an aura of shade absorbs a total of 12 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 120), it expires. For as long as the aura is active, the subject's weapon or natural weapon melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of cold damage.
Bend Perspective
	SOURCEPAGE:p.142
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Eyes of Darkness=1
	SCHOOL:Divination
	SUBSCHOOL:Scrying
	RANGE:Personal
	TARGETAREA:You
	DURATION:1 minute/level (D)
	DESC:You send your vision through shadows and into planar refl ections,altering your point of view. You view the world as though you were standing in a different spot, up to a maximum distance of 25 feet plus 5 feet per two caster levels. You cannot see through solid objects. You can, however, look around corners or over barriers, obtain a bird's-eye view of your area, and the like. Essentially, you shift your perspective as though you were located at any spot in range to which you have line of effect. You can switch back and forth between your own eyes and your alternate viewpoint as a swift action. You can move your alternate perspective, as in the spell arcane eye. Its speed is only 10 feet per round, however, and every round of such movement decreases the mystery's duration by 1 minute (if you move the perspective in the last minute of the duration, you gain a few seconds of vision at the new position before the effect expires).
Black Candle
	SOURCEPAGE:p.142
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Fundamental=1
	SCHOOL:Evocation
	DESCRIPTOR:Light|Darkness
	RANGE:Touch
	TARGETAREA:Object touched
	DURATION:1 round/level (D)
	SAVEINFO:None
	SPELLRES:No
	DESC:You draw on extraplanar shadow or banish existing shadows to let in the light. This mystery functions like the spell light or the spell darkness. Only one of these two effects is possible per use, and you must decide which effect is desired when casting.
Black Fire
	SOURCEPAGE:p.142
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Dark Terrain=2
	SCHOOL:Evocation
	DESCRIPTOR:Cold
	RANGE:Close
	TARGETAREA:One 5-ft. square/level (S)
	DURATION:1 round/level (D)
	SAVEINFO:Refl ex negates; see text
	SPELLRES:Yes
	DESC:You open a conduit to the Plane of Shadow, drawing its elements into the world and igniting a black fi re on the ground. You create a shapeable shadowy curtain of black fl ame that covers the affected squares. The fi re deals 1d6 points of cold damage per two caster levels to any creature standing in an affected square at the beginning of each of your turns until the effect ends. In addition, the fl ame deals damage to any creature entering or passing through an affected square. Black fire burns only a few feet tall, so a creature can avoid the effect of the mystery by jumping or fl ying over the area.
Bolster
	SOURCEPAGE:p.142
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Body and Soul=4
	SCHOOL:Transmutation
	RANGE:Touch
	TARGETAREA:Creature touched
	DURATION:10 minutes/level or until discharged (D)
	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)
	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)
	DESC:By linking the creature touched and the Plane of Shadow, you temporarily trade some of its traits for more potent ones belonging to creatures of that shady realm. You grant the subject 5 temporary hit points for each of its Hit Dice (maximum 75). For the duration of the effect, the subject's shadow grows larger than normal, and its movements are very slightly uncoordinated with those of the subject. An observer can notice this characteristic by making a DC 20 Spot check.
Carpet Of Shadow
	SOURCEPAGE:p.142
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Dark Terrain=1
	SCHOOL:Conjuration
	SUBSCHOOL:Creation
	RANGE:Close
	TARGETAREA:One 5-ft. square/level (S)
	DURATION:1 minute/level (D)
	SAVEINFO:None
	SPELLRES:No
	DESC:The ground becomes rough and hazardous, the real fl oor superimposed with irregular terrain of the Plane of Shadow. You cloak the ground with an uneven and hard to traverse surface. The terrain becomes diffi cult, meaning that each 5-foot square within the area costs double to move into. For instance, each light undergrowth square (normally costing 2 squares of movement to move into) now costs 4 squares of movement to move into. If you cast this mystery a second time on the same area (or a portion of the same area) while the fi rst casting is still active, the second casting does not worsen the terrain further (although it would extend the duration of the effect on that area).
Caul Of Shadow
	SOURCEPAGE:p.143
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Fundamental=1
	SCHOOL:Abjuration
	RANGE:Personal
	TARGETAREA:You
	DURATION:1 minute/level (D)
	DESC:A shifting, whirling fi eld of semisolid shadows and tiny rifts in the air rises around you. Caul of shadow faintly darkens your form, but does not provide any bonuses on Hide checks or similar efforts. You gain a +1 defl ection bonus to AC, with an additional +1 for every six caster levels (maximum bonus +4).
Clinging Darkness

	SUBSCHOOL:Creation
	RANGE:Close
	TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius emanation (D)
	DURATION:1 minute/level
	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates; see text
	SPELLRES:Yes
	DEC:Shadow oozes out of the fl oors, the walls, even the air, fi lling the area with wisps of writhing blackness. Creatures within the area become coated in these clinging shadows. Any creature within the area affected by this mystery, or that enters the area on its turn, must make a Refl ex save or become immobilized (see page 140). Each round on its turn, an immobilized subject can attempt a new saving throw to end the condition. Because of the subject's condition, this save is a full-round action (but does not provoke attacks of opportunity). If an immobilized subject succeeds on its save, it still needs to save again at the start of its next turn in order to avoid succumbing to the darkness again.
Congress Of Shadows
	SOURCEPAGE:p.143
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Ebon Whispers=2
	SCHOOL:Divination
	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting
	RANGE:1 mile/level

	DURATION:Instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)
	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)
	DESC:You look toward your shadow and speak a few words knowing that some distance away, a subject hears them and might reply. You speak, and your words appear in the mind of a distant creature. The message can consist of up to fi ve words, plus one additional word per caster level. It cannot deliver command words for magic items, or in any other respect function as anything but normal speech. If the subject is where you believe it to be, the message is delivered. The subject recognizes the identity of the sender of the message if it knows you. The creature can then reply, using the same number of words that you used. The message cannot cross planar boundaries.

	DURATION:Instantaneous, then 1 round/level (D); see text
	SAVEINFO:Will negates
	SPELLRES:Yes
	DESC:You reach out and peel the subject's shadow away, then wrap it inside your own. The target of this horrid mystery must succeed on a Will saving throw or die. If the creature succumbs to the mystery and dies, it immediately returns to life, gains the dark creature template, and is under your control. The creature remains in this state for 1 round per level, and then dies again.
Curtain Of Shadows
	SOURCEPAGE:p.143
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Veil of Shadows=5

	DURATION:1 round/level (D)
	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)
	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)
	DESC:You draw the shadows around yourself or other subjects, where they waver and shift, partially obscuring form. You grant subjects concealment. If you cast this mystery on a single subject, the shadows are thicker, and the subject gains total concealment. The spell see invisibility and the mystery piercing sight do not negate these miss chances, but the spell true seeing and the mystery truth revealed do.
Dark Air Or Water
	SOURCEPAGE:p.144
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Elemental Shadows=5
	SCHOOL:Transmutation
	DESCRIPTOR:Air|Water
	DESC:Reaching out with your mind to the darkness attached to your soul, you infuse nature with shadow and compel it to do your will. This mystery functions like the spell control water or control winds. You decide which version to use at the time of casting.
Dark Soul

	SPELLRES:Yes; see text
	DESC:You open the subject's mind to the Plane of Shadow, altering its personality. You turn the dark energies from the Plane of Shadow upon another creature, compelling it to act in ways that it normally would not. While this effect is active, you can use a standard action to focus the shadow energies on one living creature within 30 feet that you select. The creature must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 17 + your Cha modifi er) or immediately make a melee attack against one target within its reach.

	SCHOOL:Universal
	RANGE:Close
	TARGETAREA:Repeat a previously cast spell or mystery
	DURATION:See text
	SAVEINFO:See text
	SPELLRES:See text
	DESC:Even as you recoil from your enemy's spell, you reach into the Plane of Shadow and draw forth the spiritual refl ection of that spell. With a grin, you manifest it in the physical world and hurl it back at him. You can "echo" a mystery or spell cast by anyone other than yourself, causing it to remanifest under your control. Both the caster and the effect must have been within echo spell's range, and the entire casting must have occurred in the previous round. You choose the mystery or spell's target, and make any other choices involved in casting it. You cast the mystery or spell using your mystery user level (use your Cha modifi er to determine the mystery or spell's DC; its duration, saves, and the like are as normal for that spell). You cannot echo a mystery or spell of a higher level than the highest-level mystery you can cast, and you can never echo a mystery or a spell of higher than 4th level.

	DESC:You detach your own shadow and animate it with extraplanar energies, creating a dark-hued, hazy duplicate of yourself.

	SAVEINFO:Will negates
	SPELLRES:Yes
	DESC:You alter your perceptions to see through any shadow, anywhere. Far sight is similar to the spell greater scrying, with the modifi cations described here. This mystery allows you to see the subject's true essence, as with the truth revealed mystery.

	DESC:You infuse one or more small objects with shadowstuff, causing them to animate at your command. This mystery functions like the spell animate objects, but the items grow dark and warped, becoming more sharp-edged and appearing slightly worn or decayed for the duration of the effect. In addition, objects animated by this mystery benefi t from concealment.

Once per round, as an immediate action, you can instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within a distance of 5 feet per two caster levels. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired-just as with the spell dimension door. If you cast flicker in response to an attack against you, the strike has a 50% miss chance.

	SCHOOL:Abjuration
	RANGE:Close
	TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius spread
	DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)
	SAVEINFO:None
	SPELLRES:See text
	DESC:You inundate the area with strange energies from the Plane of Shadow, warping the effects of magic. A fl ood of mystical shadow-power renders casting more diffi cult. To cast most spells while in, or into, an area affected by fl ood of shadow, the caster must succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level), or the spell is lost with no effect. Mysteries or any spells of the shadow subschool can be cast within or into the affected area without making the Spellcraft check. In addition, if a mystery or a spell of the shadow subschool originates in an area affected by f lood of shadow, its variable numerical effect is increased by 50% (as if it was empowered), although its level does not increase.

	DESC:You channel shadowstuff into the subject's shadow, literally weighing him down under its weight. Languor functions like either the spell slow or the spell hold monster.

	DESC:A wave of darkness washes over the subject, sapping his energy into the Plane of Shadow. Your touch deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 5d6) and causes the subject to become fatigued for 1 round per caster level (a Fortitude save negates the fatigue). This mystery does not stack with itself, so a creature fatigued by one casting does not become exhausted by a second casting.

	DESC:The shadows around your hand seem to weep, leaving a small puddle of dark tears. You create a quantity of ink great enough for you to write approximately one page of text. It is not of suffi cient quality to scribe spells. In darkness or shadowy illumination, the ink glows with red or yellow light that has the brightness of a candle. Water splashed on the ink causes it to wash away and cease glowing, but otherwise the ink continues to glow indefinitely.

This prison blocks both line of effect and line of sight to the creature inside it, and is impenetrable from the outside. The creature inside the prison takes 1d6 points of cold damage at the beginning of each round that it remains inside the prison. Once each round as a standard action, a creature caught in the prison can attempt a Fortitude saving throw against the spell's original DC to break out of the prison. Success means that the creature can move out of the prison, and it fades to nothingness. Failure means that the creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and remains trapped.

	DESC:Using the greatest of magic, you peer through the Plane of Shadow back into the Material Plane, and view shadows and refl ections of events that have not yet happened. This mystery grants you knowledge of what will occur (or at least what is likely to occur), granting you several benefi ts. You gain the uncanny dodge ability, a +10 insight bonus on initiative checks (you always get to act in a surprise round), and a +4 insight bonus to Armor Class. In addition, you can discharge the energy of this mystery as an immediate action to cause an attack to miss you that would otherwise have been successful. You can declare that you are using this ability after the result of the attack roll is known, but you must do so before damage is determined. Using this ability discharges and ends the mystery.

	DURATION:Instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:Refl ex half
	SPELLRES:Yes
	DESC:From a sudden rift into the Plane of Shadow, a cold wind begins to blow. Torrents of shadow arc out, draining the life from nearby creatures. This mystery creates a blast of electricity and cold energy, much like some of the most fearsome weather found on the Plane of Shadow. The storm strikes one target initially, then arcs to other targets. The storm deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Half of this damage is electricity damage, and the other half is cold damage. After it strikes, the storm arcs (like the spell chain lightning) to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum twenty). The secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (round down).

	SCHOOL:Transmutation
	RANGE:Medium
	TARGETAREA:One creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher
	DURATION:1 round/level (D)
	SAVEINFO:Will negates
	SPELLRES:Yes
	DESC:The subject's vision overlaps the Plane of Shadow, causing him to see fl ickering images, areas of darkness, and other visual discrepancies with the material world. You impede the subject's vision and its ability to determine what's happening around it. The subject takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. In addition, you have total concealment with respect to the subject (miss chance applies during each round of the duration).

Sharp Shadows
	SOURCEPAGE:p.150
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Cloak of Shadows=3
	SCHOOL:Abjuration
	RANGE:Personal
	TARGETAREA:You
	DURATION:1 minute/level (D)
	DESC:You cloak yourself in sharp spikes of darkness. Although they are weightless and do nothing to impede you, your foes soon discover that they're not so lucky. A creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). A creature wielding a reach weapon, such as a longspear, is not subject to this damage if it attacks you. If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect (unless you used the mystery as a supernatural ability). Damage from sharp shadows is not considered magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, and the effect is not considered a weapon for the purpose of spells such as align weapon or magic weapon.

	SAVEINFO:Will negates
	SPELLRES:Yes
	DESC:Tendrils of shadow creep from your fi ngers, through the Plane of Shadow, and into the soul of the subject by way of its own shadow. You now control the creature's actions as if it were a puppet. The control granted by soul puppet follows the same mechanics as the spell dominate monster. Anyone observing the subject with the spell true seeing, the mystery truth revealed, or a similar ability sees tendrils of darkness extending a few feet from the subject before fading into nothingness. Similarly, anyone observing you while using similar abilities notices tendrils extending from your fi ngers, also fading into nothing.
Steel Shadows

	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Cloak of Shadows=1
	SCHOOL:Abjuration

	TARGETAREA:You
	DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)
	DESC:Darkness coalesces about your body, forming a shadow-shape of armor and another that looks like a shield. Although they are as weightless as the air, you know they'll protect you as well as if they were made of steel. Steel shadows grants you a +3 armor bonus and a +3 shield bonus to AC, but without weight, armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. The effect is not a force effect, and attacks from incorporeal creatures ignore it.

	DURATION:Instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:None and Will negates (object)
	SPELLRES:No and Yes (object)
	DESC:You transport yourself through the Plane of Shadow to any spot within range. Your shadow stretches out from you until it reaches your chosen destination, passing through solid objects and moving independently of the ambient light. You appear to fall into your shadow at one end, and rise from it at the other. This mystery functions like the spell dimension door.

	DESC:You open the subject's mind to shadow, and the new perceptions it offers. You grant the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. You decide which ability you are enhancing when you cast the mystery, and you may not later alter your choice.
Tomb Of Night
	SOURCEPAGE:p.151
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Ebon Walls=8
	SCHOOL:Conjuration
	SUBSCHOOL:Creation
	DESC:You temporarily banish your foe to the depths of shadow. This mystery functions like the mystery prison of night, except that instead of taking Constitution damage upon failing a Fortitude saving throw to escape the prison, the creature gains one negative level. In addition, tomb of night deals 3d6 points of cold damage per round.
Truth Revealed
	SOURCEPAGE:p.151
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Eyes of the Night Sky=7
	SCHOOL:Divination
	RANGE:Personal
	TARGETAREA:You
	DURATION:1 minute/level (D); see text
	DESC:By focusing on the spiritual shadow of the world, you can see hidden truths. At its most basic, this mystery functions like the spell true seeing. You can also, by concentrating on a particular creature or object for 1 minute or more, gain additional information on that subject. However, because of the distortion between worlds and the twisting effect of shadows, any additional information gained in this manner might be false or misleading. The table below indicates what other mystical effects can be duplicated with truth revealed. Concentrating on a specifi c target requires a substantial amount of time, during which you can only take move actions, and cannot focus on any other target. At the end of this period, the target makes a saving throw against the DC of truth revealed to resist the detection effect. Spell resistance applies to this further detection effect as well. You may not attempt any one effect on the same target more than once per use of truth revealed. Remember that these effects are in addition to the basic knowledge granted by true seeing, which occurs instantly and reliably.

	RANGE:Close
	TARGETAREA:One unattended object weighing up to 5 lb./level
	DURATION:1 round/ level (D)
	SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)
	SPELLRES:No
	DESC:You point your fi nger at a distant object, and the shadows seem to grasp and tug at it. This mystery functions like the spell mage hand, except you can manipulate heavier objects and magic items. Magic items are allowed a saving throw to negate the effect. You need not concentrate on the effect, but you must direct it with your thoughts once each round (a free action), or the effect ends.
Umbral Touch
	SOURCEPAGE:p.152
	CLASSES:Shadow Mystery,Touch of Twilight=3
	SCHOOL:Conjuration
	RANGE:Touch
	TARGETAREA:Creature or creatures touched
	DURATION:1 minute/level (D); see text
	SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial; see text
	SPELLRES:Yes
	DESC:Darkness surrounds your hand, turning it into a deadly weapon. Umbral touch infuses one of your hands with dark, shadowy energy, allowing you to make debilitating melee touch attacks. A successful strike deals 5d6 points of damage to a target, which must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or also be slowed. While this mystery is active, you threaten an area as if you were armed and can make attacks of opportunity with your umbral touch. This mystery completely occupies one of your hands, as if you were holding an object in that hand. If you have another open hand, you can cast other mysteries or spells normally, even those with a range of touch, but you cannot deliver another touch mystery or touch spell and make an attack with umbral touch in the same round. This effect normally lasts for 1 minute per level, but each successful touch attack shortens the duration by 1 minute (allowing you to make one successful attack per level before the effect is discharged).

	DURATION:Instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)
	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)
	DESC:Reaching into the shadow of the creature, you grasp the shadows of the deleterious things that affect it and tear them away. This mystery immediately ends any of the following adverse conditions: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, immobilized, insanity, nauseated, sickened, stunned, and poisoned. In addition, it negates the effects of the mysteries mesmerizing shade, shadow hood, and shadow between, and cancels curses as the spell remove curse.

	SAVEINFO:Will negates
	SPELLRES:Yes
	DESC:You and other creatures you touch enter the Plane of Shadow for a brief span, using it as a means of crossing great distances on the Material Plane. This mystery functions like the spell shadow walk, except as noted here. Your movement rate on the Plane of Shadow is double that described by the spell. Further, upon reaching your destination, you can attempt a DC 30 Knowledge (the planes) check; success indicates that you appear exactly where you wish, rather than being shunted to a nearby space as per the spell. You need not leave the Plane of Shadow once you enter it, and this mystery can be used on the Plane of Shadow to travel rapidly.
Warp Spell
	SOURCEPAGE:p.153

	SCHOOL:Abjuration
	RANGE:Close
	TARGETAREA:A spell or mystery cast by someone else
	DURATION:Instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text
	SPELLRES:No
	DESC:You reach out with shadowy energies, banishing your foe's spell or mystery into the Plane of Shadow while replacing it with its dark refl ection. You can cast this mystery as an immediate action to warp another caster's spell or mystery. In this case, warp spell must be used at the moment of the other caster's casting. To be successful, you must beat the other caster on an opposed caster level check (1d20 + caster level). If you do not, you have failed to take control of his spell or mystery, and it manifests normally. If you succeed on the opposed check, the other caster's mystery or spell is countered, as if you had used the counterspell action successfully, and you gain one additional use of an apprentice-path mystery that you know. You can keep this additional use until a later turn (requiring a standard action to activate), but it must be used within 1 hour or it is lost. You can also combine the activation of the additional spell or mystery with the immediate action required for the warp spell mystery itself, allowing you to cast the apprentice-path mystery out of turn.

You gain low-light vision, enabling you to see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, shadowy illumination, and similar conditions of poor illumination. If you already have low-light vision, these effects stack, enabling you to see four times as far as a human in poor illumination.
