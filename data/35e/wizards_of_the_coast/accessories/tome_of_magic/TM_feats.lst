	BENEFIT:Choose a mystery you know. You cast that mystery as a supernatural ability instead of a spell-like ability, or as a spell-like ability instead of as a spell. If you choose a mystery that you cast as a supernatural ability, or if you later gain the ability to cast that mystery as a supernatural ability, you gain an extra use of that mystery per day.

When you take the feat again, you can choose to affect the same mystery or a different one.
Greater Path Focus	SOURCEPAGE:p.136	TYPE:Shadow Magic

The target must still be within the spell's maximum range, and you must have had line of sight and line of effect within a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifi er. The target gains a bonus on his save, if any, equal to the number of rounds since you had line of sight or effect. You cannot apply this feat to any mystery that requires a touch or ranged touch. Casting a mystery with Line of Shadow is a full-round action. Normal: You must have line of effect or line of sight to target a creature or object with a mystery or spell.

This bonus stacks with similar bonuses, such those from the Path Focus or Spell Focus feats. The ambient light is irrelevant, nor does it matter if you can see the sky. Only the actual time of day matters. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times, but its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new school or path.
Path Focus	SOURCEPAGE:p.137	TYPE:Shadow Magic
	DESC:Choose a path of shadow magic, such as Touch of Twilight. Your mysteries of that path are more potent than normal.
	BENEFIT:You function at +1 caster level when casting mysteries of this path. Additionally, add +1 to the DC of all saving throws against mysteries from this path. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new path.

	PREFEAT:1,TYPE=Metashadow

Shadow Cast	SOURCEPAGE:p.137	TYPE:Shadow Magic
	DESC:Your shadow shimmers as you cast a spell and you seem to cast your mysteries from elsewhere.
	PRESKILL:1,Concentration=5
	PRECLASS:1,Shadowcaster=1
	BENEFIT:Designate a square adjacent to you. If no one threatens that square, you do not provoke an attack of opportunity when you cast a spell or use a spell-like ability.
Shadow Familiar	SOURCEPAGE:p.138	TYPE:Shadow Magic
	DESC:Noctumancers developed this feat in order to gain a mystical companion.
	PRECLASS:1,Shadowcaster=3
	BENEFIT:You can obtain a familiar in the same manner as a sorcerer or wizard, but it possesses the dark template. As with a sorcerer or wizard, obtaining a familiar takes 24 hours and uses up magic materials worth 100 gp. For the purpose of determining familiar abilities that depend on your arcane caster level, your levels in all classes that allow you to cast mysteries or arcane spells stack. Special: If you gain access to an alternative familiar, such as through the Improved Familiar feat, it also gains the dark template.
Shadow Reflection	SOURCEPAGE:p.138	TYPE:Shadow Magic

	PRESTAT:1,WIS=15
	PRESPELL:1,Bend Perspective,Truth Revealed
	BENEFIT:As long as you are in shadowy illumination or darkness, you can take a move action to sense the number of creatures within 20 feet that are also within shadowy illumination or darkness and the direction to each one. You cannot pinpoint the location of any creature with this feat.
Still Mystery	SOURCEPAGE:p.138	TYPE:Shadow Magic.Metashadow
	DESC:You can cast mysteries without gestures.
	BENEFIT:A stilled mystery can be cast with no somatic components. This also prevents your shadow from making gestures that differ from your own during casting. Because mysteries activated as spell-like and supernatural abilities have no somatic components, this feat is useful only with mysteries cast as arcane spells.
Unseen Arrow	SOURCEPAGE:p.138	TYPE:Shadow Magic
	DESC:Developed by shadowblades, this feat allows a member of that class to apply his unseen weapon abilities to thrown or projectile weapons.
	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Unseen Weapon ~ shadowblade
