Truncheon		SOURCEPAGE:p.33	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.Bludgeoning.NonLethal	COST:2	WIELD:OneHanded	DAMAGE:1d8	SIZE:M	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	WT:12	SPROP:A truncheon is essentially a heavier version of the sap-a one-handed martial weapon that deals nonlethal damage. As with a sap, a rogue wielding a truncheon can deal extra nonlethal damage with a sneak attack, but only if she is proficient in its use.

#Exotic
Entangling Pole	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Reach.Piercing			COST:4	WIELD:TwoHanded	DAMAGE:1d4	SIZE:M	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	WT:5		SPROP:The entangling pole is a highly specialized weapon, used to catch and entangle an opponent without causing great harm. It is normally used to hook and catch the clothing of an opponent. When you use an entangling pole in this way, you make a grapple attack without provoking an attack of opportunity. You make a melee touch attack with the weapon to "grab" the target's clothing. This attack does not work against a character in heavy armor, or against most monsters that do not wear clothing (though it does work against a monster with shaggy fur). If the touch attack is successful, you make an opposed grapple check, using the size modifier for the entangling pole (+4 for a two-handed weapon) instead of your own size. If you win the opposed check, you have a hold on the target, but you do not deal any damage. If you lose, you fail to start the grapple. To maintain the grapple, you do not need to move into your opponent's space. The entangling pole holds your opponent 10 feet away from you. While you maintain the grapple, you do not have the option to damage or pin your opponent. Your opponent can try to escape or wriggle free, attack with a light weapon, or cast a spell with no somatic components and a casting time of 1 standard action. An entangling pole can also be used as a normal weapon, dealing the damage shown on Table 3-1 but not entangling the opponent. An entangling pole has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.
Grasping Pole	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Reach.Bludgeoning.NonLethal	COST:8	WIELD:TwoHanded	DAMAGE:1d4	SIZE:M	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	WT:8		SPROP:The grasping pole is a pole arm designed to capture opponents with a minimum of harm. A wielder who hits a Small or Medium opponent with a grasping pole can immediately initiate a grapple (as a free action) without provoking an attack of opportunity. (See Grapple in Chapter 8: Combat of the Player's Handbook for more information.) In addition to the normal options available to a grappler, the wielder of a grasping pole can attempt to pull his target to the ground (the equivalent of a trip attack, though no attack roll is necessary). A grasping pole has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.
#Ranged
Lasso			SOURCEPAGE:p.33	TYPE:Weapon.Ranged.Exotic.Thrown	RANGE:10	COST:2	SLOTS:2	WIELD:TwoHanded	WT:3	COST:1	SPROP:A lasso is an entangling weapon that deals no damage, but it entangles only parts of an opponent's body. When you use a lasso to entangle your opponent's arms, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A lasso's maximum range is 30 feet. If you hit, the target is partially entangled, taking a -2 on attack rolls and a -4 penalty on effective Dexterity. The creature's speed is not reduced, and it can still charge or run, but if you control the trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while holding it, the lassoed creature can only move within the limits that the rope allows. If the lassoed creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a DC 15 Concentration check or be unable to cast the spell. The lassoed creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check as a full-round action. The lasso has 2 hp and can be broken with a DC 23 Strength check-also a full-round action. Alternatively, you can use a lasso to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the lasso to avoid being tripped.

### Specific EQUIPMENT:

Moonblood	COST:1500	TYPE:Consumable.Material	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SPROP:Celestials use this silvery substance as warpaint, painting their faces and other exposed areas of their bodies with elaborately entwined holy runes before entering battle. Proper application of moonblood warpaint takes 1 hour and requires a DC 22 Craft (painting) check; a failed check means no benefits are gained and the moonblood is wasted. When the moonblood runes are properly applied, the warpaint grants a +2 sacred bonus to Armor Class. The warpaint lasts for 1 day, then is absorbed harmlessly into the skin. An evil creature that touches moonblood takes 1d6 points of damage. One application of moonblood costs 1,500 gp.	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=Sacred|PREAPPLY:ANYPC
