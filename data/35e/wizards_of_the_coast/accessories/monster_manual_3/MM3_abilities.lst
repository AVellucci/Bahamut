# Actual Abilities with Descriptions
Detect Thoughts (Su)		KEY:Detect Thoughts ~ Naztharune		SOURCEPAGE:p.136	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.NaztharuneRaceTrait.SpecialAttack	DESC:A naztharune rakshasa can continuously use detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 17 negates). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Change Shape (Su)			KEY:Change Shape ~ Naztharune			SOURCEPAGE:p.136	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.NaztharuneRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:A naztharune rakshasa can assume any humanoid form, or revert to its own form, as a standard action. In humanoid form, a naztharune loses its claw attacks (although it usually uses weapons and armor). A naztharune rakshasa typically remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but a naztharune reverts to its natural form when killed. A true seeing spell reveals its natural form.
Evasion (Ex)			KEY:Evasion ~ Naztharune		SERVESAS:ABILITY|Evasion	SOURCEPAGE:p.136	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.NaztharuneRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:If a naztharune rakshasa is exposed to any effect that normally allows it to attempt a Ref lex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage with a successful saving throw.
Hide in Plain Sight (Su)	KEY:Hide in Plain Sight ~ Naztharune	SOURCEPAGE:p.136	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.NaztharuneRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:A naztharune rakshasa can use the Hide skill even while being observed. As long as it is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, a naztharune rakshasa can hide itself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. It cannot, however, hide in its own shadow.
Improved Evasion (Ex)		KEY:Improved Evasion ~ Naztharune		SOURCEPAGE:p.137	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.NaztharuneRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:This ability works like evasion, except that while a naztharune rakshasa still takes no damage on a successful Refl ex save against spells such as a fireball or a breath weapon, it now takes only half damage on a failed save.
Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)	KEY:Improved Uncanny Dodge ~ Naztharune	SOURCEPAGE:p.137	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.NaztharuneRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:A naztharune rakshasa cannot be flanked except by a rogue of at least 15th level.
Shadow Jump (Su)			KEY:Shadow Jump ~ Naztharune			SOURCEPAGE:p.137	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.NaztharuneRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:A naztharune rakshasa has the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A naztharune can jump up to 20 feet each day in this way; this can be a single jump of 20 feet or two jumps of 10 feet each.
Sneak Attack (Ex)			KEY:Sneak Attack ~ Naztharune			SOURCEPAGE:p.137	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.NaztharuneRaceTrait.SpecialAttack	DESC:If a naztharune rakshasa can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from its attack, it can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Basically, the naztharune rakshasa's attack deals extra damage any time its target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the naztharune rakshasa flanks its target. The naztharune rakshasa's sneak attack ability is equivalent to that of a rogue of a level equal to the creature's Hit Dice. Should the naztharune rakshasa score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.
Uncanny Dodge (Ex)		KEY:Uncanny Dodge ~ Naztharune		SOURCEPAGE:p.137	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.NaztharuneRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:A naztharune rakshasa can react to danger before its senses would normally allow it to do so. It retains its Dexterity bonus to AC even when caught flat-footed.
Skills				KEY:Skills ~ Naztharune				SOURCEPAGE:p.137	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.NaztharuneRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:A naztharune rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff checks and Disguise checks. *When using change shape, a naztharune rakshasa gains an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If it is reading an opponent's mind, its circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks increases by a further +4.	BONUS:SKILL|Bluff,Disguise|4|TYPE=Racial
