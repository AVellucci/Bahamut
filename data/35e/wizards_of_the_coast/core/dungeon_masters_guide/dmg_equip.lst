Blowgun								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Blowgun		TYPE:Piercing.Weapon.Ranged					COST:1	WT:2		CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1			DAMAGE:1							RANGE:10			
	SOURCEPAGE:p.144	SPROP: This weapon is used to propel small needles a long distance. It is silent, and its needles most often are used to poison foes. Needles, Blowgun: These 2-inch-long iron needles are sold in small wooden cases of 20. A full case is so light that its weight is negligible. The tips of the needles are often coated with poison such as greenblood oil, bloodroot, blue whinnis, shadow essence, or deathblade.

Wakizashi								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Sword (Short)	TYPE:Martial.Weapon.Light.Melee.Slashing			COST:300	WT:3		CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:2			DAMAGE:1d6									SIZE:M	
	SOURCEPAGE:p.144	SPROP:This small, slightly curved short sword is made with a skill only masterful weaponsmiths possess. It counts as a masterwork weapon and grants its wielder a +1 bonus on attack rolls. A masterwork weapon's bonus on attack rolls does not stack with an enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
Kusari-Gama								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Kusari-Gama	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.Light.Exotic.Slashing		COST:10			CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1			DAMAGE:1d6											
	SOURCEPAGE:p.144	SPROP:This small sickle is attached to a length of chain. A kusari-gama is an exotic weapon that has reach. It can strike opponents 10 feet away. In addition, unlike other weapons with reach, it can be used against an adjacent foe. It can be used in all respects like a spiked chain (see page 115 of the Player's Handbook) for trip attacks, disarming other foes, and using its wielder's Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier in attack rolls.
Katana								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Sword (Bastard)	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Slashing.Exotic.Martial			COST:400	WT:6		CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:2			DAMAGE:1d10	EQMOD:MWORKW	WIELD:TwoHanded					
	SOURCEPAGE:p.144	SPROP:While functionally a bastard sword, this sword is the most masterfully made nonmagical weapon in existence. It counts as a masterwork weapon and grants its wielder a +1 bonus on attack rolls. A katana is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A Medium creature can use a katana two-handed as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. With Exotic Weapon Proficiency (katana), a Medium creature can use it in one hand. A masterwork weapon's bonus on attack rolls does not stack with an enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

Pistol								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Pistol		TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Firearm.Piercing.Ranged.Projectile	COST:250	WT:3		CRITMULT:x3							DAMAGE:1d10							RANGE:50	SIZE:M

	SOURCEPAGE:p.145

#Gunpowder	TYPE:Firearm.Gunpowder	COST:2	
	SOURCEPAGE:p.145	SPROP: While gunpowder burns (1 ounce consumes itself in 1 round and illuminates like a sunrod) or even explodes in the right conditions, it is chiefly used to propel a bullet out of the barrel of a pistol or a rifle, or it is formed into a bomb (see below). An ounce of gunpowder is needed to propel a bullet. Gunpowder is sold in small kegs (15-pound capacity, 20 pounds total weight, 250 gp each) and in water-resistant powder horns (2-pound capacity and total weight, 35 gp for a full powder horn). If gunpowder gets wet, it cannot be used to fire a bullet.

	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	QUALITY:Era|Modern	SPROP:An automatic pistol can fire fifteen times before reloading and can be used to attack more than once per round if the user has the ability to make multiple attacks. Releasing an empty magazine and inserting a new one is a move action.
Pistol, Revolver		KEY:Pistol (Revolver)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Pistol (Revolver		TYPE:ModernEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Piercing	WT:3		CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1			DAMAGE:2d8	RANGE:30	
	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	QUALITY:Era|Modern	SPROP:A revolver can fire six times before it needs reloading (which requires a full-round action).
Rifle, Hunting		KEY:Rifle (Hunting)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Rifle (Hunting)		TYPE:ModernEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Piercing	WT:8		CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1			DAMAGE:2d10	RANGE:80	
	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	QUALITY:Era|Modern	SPROP:A hunting rifle can fire five times before it needs reloading (which requires a full-round action).
Rifle, Automatic		KEY:Rifle (Automatic)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Rifle (Automatic)	TYPE:ModernEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Piercing	WT:8		CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1			DAMAGE:2d8	RANGE:80	
	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	QUALITY:Era|Modern	SPROP:An automatic rifle can fire thirty times before it needs reloading. Releasing an empty magazine and inserting a new one is a move action. As an attack, an automatic rifle can instead spray a space 10 feet across with ten bullets. If the attacker succeeds on an attack roll against AC 10, everyone in that space must make a DC 15 Reflex save or take the weapon's damage.
Shotgun								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Shotgun			TYPE:ModernEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Piercing	WT:7		CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1			DAMAGE:2d8	RANGE:30	
	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	QUALITY:Era|Modern	SPROP:A shotgun is most effective at close range; on any successful attack, a -1 penalty is applied to the damage roll for each range increment of the attack. It can fire six times before it needs reloading (which requires a full-round action). The weapon uses shotgun shells, cylindrical cartridges that have a built-in firing cap at their base. They are packed with a mixture of gunpowder and small lead pellets.
Grenade Launcher							PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Grenade Launcher		TYPE:ModernEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm			WT:7						CRITRANGE:1					RANGE:70	
	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	QUALITY:Era|Modern	SPROP:A grenade launcher can fire fragmentation or smoke grenades using its range increment, but must be reloaded each time it fires, requiring a standard action. A grenade launcher is a tube set on a metal tripod and equipped with a sighting mechanism. A single smoke grenade or fragmentation grenade easily slips into the tube.
# Explosives
Dynamite																																							
	SOURCEPAGE:p.146					SPROP:This short, thin cylinder of explosive material has a fuse that must be lit before it is thrown or set. Lighting a stick of dynamite is a move action, and the dynamite goes off in the same round or up to several minutes later (depending on how long the fuse is). The explosive has a blast radius of 5 feet and deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage. Anyone caught within the blast radius can make a DC 15 Reflex save to take half damage. It's possible to bind together several sticks of dynamite so they ignite and explode at the same time. Each additional stick increases the damage by 1d6 (maximum damage 10d6) and the burst radius by 5 feet (maximum burst radius 20 feet).
Grenade, Fragmentation	KEY:Grenade (Fragmentation)	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|NoProfReq																											
	SOURCEPAGE:p.146					SPROP:A fragmentation grenade looks like a large egg, sometimes mounted on a 1-foot-long stick with small fins. If thrown, it uses its range increment, but if launched from a grenade launcher, it uses that weapon's range increment. Fragmentation grenades are advanced antipersonnel explosives that deal slashing damage in a 20-foot radius. Anyone caught within the blast radius can make a DC 15 Reflex save to take half damage.
Grenade, Smoke		KEY:Grenade (Smoke)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|NoProfReq																											
	SOURCEPAGE:p.146					SPROP:A smoke grenade looks like a squat cylinder, sometimes mounted on a 1-foot-long stick with small fins. If thrown, it uses its range increment, but if launched from a grenade launcher, it uses that weapon's range increment. One round after it lands or hits its target, this nondamaging explosive emits a cloud of smoke (as the fog cloud spell) in a 20-foot radius. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

	SOURCEPAGE:p.147			QUALITY:Era|Futuristic	SPROP:A laser pistol fires fifty times before a new energy cell (weight 1 pound) needs to be reloaded and has a rate of fire equal to the attacker's number of attacks. Reloading the weapon is a move action.
Antimatter Rifle	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Antimatter Rifle	TYPE:FuturisticEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Futuristic				WT:10		SLOTS:2	CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1			DAMAGE:6d8	WIELD:TwoHanded	RANGE:120	
	SOURCEPAGE:p.147			QUALITY:Era|Futuristic	SPROP:An antimatter rifle is a devastating short-range attack weapon that can be fired once per round. It holds an energy cell (weight 1 pound) that is depleted after two shots. Reloading the weapon is a move action.

	SOURCEPAGE:p.147			QUALITY:Era|Futuristic	SPROP:A flamer can be fired once per round. Unlike other ranged weapons, it deals damage to every square in a 5-foot-wide stream extending out to the flamer's maximum range (200 feet). It contains a fuel pack with enough concentrated flamer fuel for ten shots. Installing a new fuel pack requires a full-round action.
Laser Rifle		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Laser Rifle	TYPE:FuturisticEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Futuristic				WT:7		SLOTS:2	CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1			DAMAGE:3d8	WIELD:TwoHanded	RANGE:100

No aura (nonmagical)
Banded Mail of Luck		PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Banded Mail	TYPE:Magic.Enhancement.Armor.Heavy.Suit.Specific	COST:250	WT:35		ACCHECK:-6		EQMOD:MAGIC_COST|9500.MWORKA.PLUS3A.STEEL		MAXDEX:1			SOURCEPAGE:p.220	SPELLFAILURE:35																						BONUS:COMBAT|AC|6|TYPE=Armor																			SPROP:Ten 100-gp gems adorn this +3 banded mail. Once per week, the armor allows its wearer to require that an attack roll made against him be rerolled. He must take whatever consequences come from the second roll, since not all luck is good. The wearer's player must decide whether to have the attack roll rerolled before damage is rolled. Strong enchantment; CL 12th
Breastplate of Command		PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Breastplate	TYPE:Magic.Enhancement.Armor.Medium.Suit.Specific	COST:200	WT:30		ACCHECK:-4		EQMOD:MAGIC_COST|21050.MWORKA.PLUS2A.STEEL	MAXDEX:3			SOURCEPAGE:p.220	SPELLFAILURE:25																						BONUS:COMBAT|AC|5|TYPE=Armor	BONUS:SKILL|TYPE=Charisma|2|TYPE=Competence	BONUS:VAR|LeadershipScore,TurnCheckBase|2|TYPE=Competence	SPROP:This finely crafted +2 breastplate radiates a powerful aura of magic. When worn, the armor bestows a dignified and commanding aura upon its owner. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma checks, including turning checks and Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus to his Leadership score (see page 106). Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal (for example, more willing than normal to follow a leader into battle against dangerous foes). Since the effect arises in great part from the distinctiveness of the armor, the wearer cannot hide or conceal herself in any way and still have the effect function.

It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +8, an armor check penalty of -2, and an arcane spell failure chance of 15%. It is considered light armor, weighs 20 pounds, and it allows the wearer to use fly on command (as the spell) once per day. Faint transmutation [good]; CL 5th
Demon Armor				PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Full Plate	TYPE:Magic.Enhancement.Armor.Heavy.Suit.Specific	COST:1500	WT:50		ACCHECK:-6		EQMOD:MAGIC_COST|34610.MWORKA.PLUS4A.STEEL	MAXDEX:1			SOURCEPAGE:p.220	SPELLFAILURE:35		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Negative Levels												BONUS:COMBAT|AC|8|TYPE=Armor									BONUS:VAR|NegLevels|1|PREALIGN:LG,LN,NG,TN,CG,CN		SPROP:This plate armor is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be a demon. The helmet is shaped to look like a horned demon head, and its wearer looks out of the open, tooth-filled mouth. This +4 full plate allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a contagion spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of contagion requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The "claws" are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets. The armor bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. The negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the armor is worn.

However, the bow is treated as only a masterwork weapon against all foes other than the sworn enemy, and the wielder takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls with any weapon other than the oathbow. These bonuses and penalties last for seven days or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wielder of the oathbow, whichever comes first. The oathbow may only have one sworn enemy at a time. Once the wielder swears to slay a target, he cannot make a new oath until he has slain that target or seven days have passed. Even if the wielder slays the sworn enemy on the same day that he makes the oath, he cannot activate the oathbow's special power again until 24 hours have passed from the time he made the oath.

However, a sun blade is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. (In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword.) Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack. In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 bastard sword. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and ?3 on a critical hit instead of the usual ?2). The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above her head while speaking a command word. The sunblade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that is like full daylight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the sword is wielded. Moderate evocation; CL 10th

Ring of Counterspells																											TYPE:Magic.Ring								COST:4000	WT:0																												SPROP:This ring might seem to be a ring of spell storing upon first examination. However, while it allows a single spell of 1st through 6th level to be cast into it, that spell cannot be cast out of the ring again. Instead, should that spell ever be cast upon the wearer, the spell is immediately countered, as a counterspell action, requiring no action (or even knowledge) on the wearer's part. Once so used, the spell cast within the ring is gone. A new spell (or the same one as before) may be placed in it again. Moderate evocation; CL 11th	SOURCEPAGE:p.230
Ring of Djinni Calling																											TYPE:Magic.Ring								COST:125000	WT:0																												SPROP:One of the many rings of fable, this "genie" ring is most useful indeed. It serves as a special gate by means of which a specific djinni can be called from the Elemental Plane of Air. When the ring is rubbed (a standard action), the call goes out, and the djinni appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless. See the Monster Manual for details of a djinni's abilities. Strong conjuration; CL 17th	SOURCEPAGE:p.230
Ring (Elemental Command/Air)										OUTPUTNAME:Ring of Elemental Command (Air)									TYPE:Magic.Ring								COST:200000	WT:0																												SPROP:All four kinds of elemental command rings are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (see below), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties. Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of him. If the wearer desires, he may forego this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made. Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned who attack the wearer take a -1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws from the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. He gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapon he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have. The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which his ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that he wears the ring. They show a healthy respect for the wearer if alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if he is strong. If he is weak, they hate and desire to slay him. Fear, hatred, and respect are determined by the DM. The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows: -2 against earth-based effects.	SPROP:. Feather fall (unlimited use, wearer only) . Resist energy (electricity) (unlimited use, wearer only) . Gust of wind (twice per day) . Wind wall (unlimited use) . Air walk (once per day, wearer only) . Chain lightning (once per week) The ring appears to be a ring of feather falling until a certain condition is met, such as having the ring immersed in holy water, single-handedly slaying an air elemental, or whatever the DM determines necessary to activate its full potential. It must be reactivated each time a new wearer acquires it. Strong conjuration; CL 15th.	SOURCEPAGE:p.231

Ring (Ram)													OUTPUTNAME:Ring of the [NAME]												TYPE:Magic.Ring								COST:8600	WT:0															EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_50|CHARGES[50]								SPROP:The ring of the ram is an ornate ring forged of hard metal, usually iron or an iron alloy. It has the head of a ram (or a billy goat) as its device. The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ramlike force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance. The ring is useful for knocking opponents off parapets or ledges, among other things. The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. (The ram has Strength 25 and is Large.) The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended. In addition to its attack mode, the ring of the ram also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with Strength 25. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with Strength 27. If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength 29. A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item. Moderate transmutation; CL 9th	SOURCEPAGE:p.232

Ring (Shooting Stars)											OUTPUTNAME:Ring of [NAME]												TYPE:Magic.Ring								COST:50000	WT:0																												SPROP:This ring has two modes of operation, one for being in shadowy darkness or outdoors at night and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night. During the night under the open sky or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command. . Dancing lights (once per hour) . Light (twice per night) . Ball lightning (special, once per night) . Shooting stars (special, three per week) The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble dancing lights, and the ring wearer controls them in the same fashion (see the dancing lights spell description in the Player's Handbook). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created. Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. (Multiple balls can be released in the same round.) The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. They impact for 12 points of damage and spread (as a fireball) in a 5-foot-radius sphere for 24 points of fire damage. Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it makes a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. Range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes, unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a save or be hit by the projectile. Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties. . Faerie fire (twice per day) . Spark shower (special, once per day) The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arc 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying a metal weapon. Those wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon take 4d8 points of damage.

Rod (Absorption)				OUTPUTNAME:Rod of [NAME]							TYPE:Magic.Rod																COST:50000	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod																									EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_50|CHARGES[50]								SPROP:This rod acts as a magnet, drawing spells or spelllike abilities into itself. The magic absorbed must be a single-target spell or a ray directed at either the character possessing the rod or her gear. The rod then nullifies the spell's effect and stores its potential until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of her own. She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time. A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. For example, a rod that absorbs a 6th-level spell and a 3rdlevel spell has a total of nine absorbed spell levels. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared, without expending the preparation itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in hand when casting. Continuing the example above, the rod wielder could use the nine absorbed spell levels to cast one 9th-level spell, or one 5th-level and one 4th-level spell, or nine 1st-level spells, and so on. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know. A rod of absorption absorbs a maximum of fifty spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy. A more specific example: Jozan the cleric uses a brand-new rod of absorption to nullify the effect of a suggestion spell cast at him by a sorcerer. The rod has now absorbed three spell levels and can absorb forty-seven more. Jozan can cast any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell he has prepared, without loss of that preparation, by using the stored potential of the rod. Let's assume he casts hold person back at the sorcerer who just attacked him. This spell is 2nd level for him, so the rod still holds one spell level of potential, can absorb fortyseven more, and has disposed of two spell levels permanently. To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again: On a result of 71-100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored within. For example, if the first roll determines that the rod has thirty-four levels of absorption potential remaining, that means the rod has absorbed sixteen levels' worth of spells. Half of sixteen is eight, so there's a 30% chance that it still holds eight absorbed spell levels ready for use. Strong abjuration; CL 15th	SOURCEPAGE:p.234
Rod (Alertness)				OUTPUTNAME:Rod of [NAME]	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Mace (Light)	TYPE:Magic.Rod.Weapon.Simple.Melee.Bludgeoning.Mace										COST:85000	WT:4		BASEITEM:Rod		CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d6											WIELD:Light		SIZE:M			SPROP:This rod is indistinguishable from a +1 light mace. It has eight flanges on its macelike head. The rod bestows a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks. If grasped firmly, the rod enables the holder to use detect evil, detect good, detect chaos, detect law, detect magic, discern lies, light, or see invisibility. Each different use is a standard action. If the head of a rod of alertness is planted in the ground, and the possessor wills it to alertness (a standard action), the rod senses any creature within 120 feet who intends to harm the possessor. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a prayer spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning them of possible danger from the unfriendly creature or creatures within the 120-foot radius. These effects last for 10 minutes, and the rod can perform this function once per day. Last, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an animate objects spell, utilizing any eleven (or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the perimeter of a 5-foot-radius circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground. Objects remain animated for 11 rounds. The rod can perform this function once per day.

Rod (Cancellation)			OUTPUTNAME:Rod of [NAME]							TYPE:Magic.Rod.Consumable														COST:11000	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod																																						SPROP:This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item of all magical properties. The item touched must make a DC 23 Will save to prevent the rod from draining it. If a creature is holding it at the time, then the item can use the holder's Will save bonus in place of its own if the holder's is better. In such cases, contact is made by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by wish or miracle. (If a sphere of annihilation and a rod of cancellation negate each other, nothing can restore either of them.) Strong abjuration; CL 17th	SOURCEPAGE:p.234
Rod (Enemy Detection)			OUTPUTNAME:Rod of [NAME]							TYPE:Magic.Rod																COST:23500	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod																																						SPROP:This device pulses in the wielder's hand and points in the direction of any creature or creatures hostile to the bearer of the device (nearest ones first). These creatures can be invisible, ethereal, hidden, disguised, or in plain sight. Detection range is 60 feet. If the bearer of the rod concentrates for a full round, the rod pinpoints the location of the nearest enemy and indicates how many enemies are within range. The rod can be used three times each day, each use lasting up to 10 minutes. Activating the rod is a standard action. Moderate divination; CL 10th	SOURCEPAGE:p.235

The dire flail is a double weapon, which means that each of the weapon's heads can be used to attack (see the weapon description on page 117 of the Player's Handbook). The wielder can gain an extra attack (with the second head) at the cost of making all attacks at a -2 penalty (as if she had the Two-Weapon Fighting feat). Once per day the wielder can use a free action to cause the rod to grant her a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws for 10 minutes. The rod need not be in weapon form to grant this benefit. Transforming it into a weapon or back into a rod is a move action.

Rod (Flame Extinguishing)		OUTPUTNAME:Rod of [NAME]							TYPE:Magic.Rod																COST:15000	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod																																						SPROP:This rod can extinguish Medium or smaller nonmagical fires with simply a touch (a standard action). For the rod to be effective against other sorts of fires, the wielder must expend 1 or more of the rod's charges. Extinguishing a Large or larger nonmagical fire, or a magic fire of Medium or smaller (such as that of a flaming weapon or a burning hands spell), expends 1 charge. Continual magic flames, such as those of a weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell. When applied to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by fireball, flame strike, or wall of fire, extinguishing the flames expends 2 charges from the rod. If the device is used upon a fire creature (a melee touch attack), it deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature. This use requires 3 charges. A rod of flame extinguishing has 10 charges when found. Spent charges are renewed every day, so that a wielder can expend up to 10 charges in any 24-hour period. Strong transmutation; CL 12th	SOURCEPAGE:p.235
Rod (Immovable)				OUTPUTNAME:[NAME] Rod								TYPE:Magic.Rod																COST:5000	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod																																						SPROP:This rod is a flat iron bar with a small button on one end. When the button is pushed (a move action), the rod does not move from where it is, even if staying in place defies gravity. Thus, the owner can lift or place the rod wherever he wishes, push the button, and let go. Adventurers have found the immovable rod useful for holding ropes, barring doors, and all sorts of other utilitarian tasks. Many adventurers have found it useful to have more than one. Several immovable rods can even make a ladder when used together (although only two are needed). An immovable rod can support up to 8,000 pounds before falling to the ground. If a creature pushes against an immovable rod, it must make a DC_30 Strength check to move the rod up to 10 feet in a single round. Moderate transmutation; CL 10th	SOURCEPAGE:p.235

It also has several more mundane uses. The rod of lordly might is metal, thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. (Pushing any of the rod's buttons is equivalent to drawing a weapon.) It weighs 10 pounds. The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day. . Hold person upon touch, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use this power and then succeed on a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost. . Fear upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is a standard action. . Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half ) and cure the wielder of a like amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with hold person. The following weapon functions of the rod have no limit on the number of times they can be employed. . In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +2 light mace. . When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +1 flaming longsword. A blade springs from the ball, with the ball itself becoming the sword's hilt. The weapon lengthens to an overall length of 4 feet. . When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +4 battleaxe. A wide blade springs forth at the ball, and the whole lengthens to 4 feet. . When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 shortspear or +3 longspear.The spear blade springs forth, and the handle can be lengthened up to 12 feet (wielder's choice), for an overall length of from 6 feet to 15 feet. At its 15-foot length, the rod is suitable for use as a lance. The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed. . Climbing pole/ladder. When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in granite is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars three inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the pole by pushing button 5. . The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod's base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength modifier of +12. . When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder a knowledge of his approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.

However, the wielder can concentrate on a specific metal or mineral (gold, platinum, quartz, beryl, diamond, corundum, and so on). If the specific mineral is within 30 feet, the rod points to any places it is located, and the rod wielder knows the approximate quantity as well.

Rod (Negation)				OUTPUTNAME:Rod of [NAME]							TYPE:Magic.Rod																COST:37000	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod																																						SPROP:This device negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of magic items. The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray functions as a greater dispel magic spell, except it only affects magic items. To negate instantaneous effects from an item, the rod wielder needs to have used a ready action. The dispel check uses the rod's caster level (15th). The target item gets no saving throw, although the rod can't negate artifacts (even minor artifacts). The rod can function three times per day.

The python obeys all commands of the owner. (In animal form, it retains the +1 enhancement bonus on attacks and damage possessed by the rod form.) The serpent returns to rod form (a fullround action) whenever the wielder desires, or whenever it moves farther than 100 feet from the owner.

The wielder can command the obedience and fealty of creatures within 120 feet when she activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 300 Hit Dice can be ruled, but creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher are entitled to a DC 16 Will save to negate the effect. Ruled creatures obey the wielder as if she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is broken.

Rod (Security)				OUTPUTNAME:Rod of [NAME]							TYPE:Magic.Rod																COST:61000	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod																																						SPROP:This item creates a nondimensional space, a pocket paradise. There the rod's possessor and as many as 199 other creatures can stay in complete safety for a period of time, up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures affected. Thus, one creature (the rod's possessor) can stay for 200 days, four creatures can stay for 50 days, or a group of sixty creatures can stay for 3 days. All fractions are rounded down, so that a group numbering more than 100 can stay for one day only and a group of 201 or more cannot be affected by the rod. In this pocket paradise, creatures don't age, and natural healing take place at twice the normal rate. Fresh water and food (fruits and vegetables only) are in abundance. The climate is comfortable for all creatures involved. Activating the rod (a standard action) causes the wielder and all creatures touching the rod to be transported instantaneously to the paradise. Members of large groups can hold hands or otherwise maintain physical contact, allowing all connected creatures in a circle or a chain to be affected by the rod. Unwilling creatures get a DC 17 Will save to negate the effect. If such a creature succeeds on its save, other creatures beyond that point in a chain can still be affected by the rod. When the rod's effect expires or is dispelled, all the affected creatures instantly reappear in the location they occupied when the rod was activated. If something else occupies the space that a traveler would be returning to, then his body is displaced a sufficient distance to provide the space required for reentry. The rod's possessor can dismiss the effect whenever he wishes before the maximum time period expires, but the rod can only be activated once per week. Strong conjuuration; CL 20th	SOURCEPAGE:p.236
Rod (Splendor)				OUTPUTNAME:Rod of [NAME]							TYPE:Magic.Rod																COST:25000	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod																																						SPROP:The possessor of this rod gains a +4 enhancement bonus to her Charisma score for as long as she holds or carries the item. Once per day, the rod creates and garbs her in clothing of the finest fabrics, plus adornments of furs and jewels. Apparel created by the magic of the rod remains in existence for 12 hours. However, if the possessor attempts to sell or give away any part of it, to use it for a spell component, or the like, all the apparel immediately disappears. The same applies if any of it is forcibly taken from her. The value of noble garb created by the rod ranges from 7,000 to 10,000 gp (1d4+6 ? 1,000 gp)-1,000 gp for the fabric alone, 5,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for the jewel trim (maximum of twenty gems, maximum value 200 gp each). In addition, the rod has a second special power, usable once per week. Upon command, it creates a palatial tent-a huge pavilion of silk 60 feet across. Inside the tent are temporary furnishings and food suitable to the splendor of the pavilion and sufficient to entertain as many as one hundred persons. The tent and its trappings last for one day. At the end of that time, the tent and all objects associated with it (including any items that were taken out of the tent) disappear.

Its other magical powers are as follows. . Thunder: Once per day, the rod can strike as a +3 light mace, and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod's impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round. . Lightning: Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a +2 light mace (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod might not score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack hit, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still applies. The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round. . Thunderclap: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a shout spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds). . Lightning Stroke: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide lightning bolt (9d6 points of electricity damage, Reflex DC 16 half ) to a range of 200 feet. . Thunder and Lightning: Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the thunderclap described above with a lightning bolt, as in the lightning stroke. The thunderclap affects all within 10 feet of the bolt. The lightning stroke deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage.

It is usually topped with a glistening gem, its shaft straight and smooth. It has the following powers: . Magic missile (1 charge) . Ray of enfeeblement (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge) . Continual flame (1 charge) . Levitate (1 charge) . Lightning bolt (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge) . Fireball (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge) . Cone of cold (2 charges) . Hold monster (2 charges) . Wall of force (in a 10-ft.-diameter hemisphere around the caster only) (2 charges) . Globe of invulnerability (2 charges) The wielder of a staff of power gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and saving throws. The staff is also a +2 quarterstaff, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (as a free action), the staff causes double damage (?3 on a critical hit) for 1 round. A staff of power can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-footradius. All within 2 squares of the broken staff take points of damage equal to 8 ? the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take 6 ? the number of charges in damage, and those 5 or 6 squares distant take 4 ? the number of charges in damage. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence, but if he does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him. Only certain items, including the staff of the magi (page 280) and the staff of power, are capable of being used for a retributive strike. After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +2 quarterstaff. (Once empty of charges, it cannot be used for a retributive strike.)

	SPROP:This device usually appears to be a black circular amulet, although any character looking closely at it sees a dark, moving swirl of color. The amulet allows its wearer to utilize plane shift.

The user must make a DC 15 Intelligence check in order to get the amulet to take her to the plane (and the specific location on that plane) that she wants. If she fails, the amulet transports her and all those traveling with her to a random location on that plane (01-60 on d%) or to a random plane (61-100). Strong conjuration; CL 15th

If a divination spell is attempted against the wearer, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the caster had cast nondetection on herself ). Moderate abjuration; CL 8th

	SPROP:This item appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel, but it has a secret catch (Search DC 20 to locate) that opens a hatch in one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds ten (unlabeled) levers: The device has the following characteristics: hp 200; hardness 15; Spd 20 ft., swim 20 ft.; AC 20 (-1 size, +11 natural); Atk +12 melee (2d8, 2 pincers). Lever (1d10) Lever Function 1 Extend/retract legs and tail 2 Uncover/cover forward porthole 3 Uncover/cover side portholes 4 Extend/retract pincers and feelers 5 Snap pincers 6 Move forward/backward 7 Turn left/right 8 Open "eyes" with continual flame inside/close "eyes" 9 Rise/sink in water 10 Open/close hatch Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be operated more than once per round. However, since two Medium characters can fit inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round. The device can function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a single occupant). When activated, the apparatus looks something like a giant lobster.

Bag of Holding (Type I)		SORTKEY:Bag of Holding 1							OUTPUTNAME:Bag of Holding Type I		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Container						CONTAINS:*250										COST:2500	WT:15																						
	SPROP:This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space: Its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag's contents, depend on the bag's type. If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined. All contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action-unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole (page 264), a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: Bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process.

Bead of Force																	TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable																	COST:3000	WT:0																						
	SPROP:This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. You can throw it up to 60 feet with no range penalties. Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6 points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius. It functions like an Otiluke's resilient sphere spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, disintegrate, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within. The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item. Moderate evocation; CL 10th

If a command word is given, however, the box unfolds itself to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold to a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship. In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold four people comfortably, while the ship carries fifteen with ease. A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again.

It is about 1 foot in diameter, half that deep, and relatively fragile. When the bowl is filled with fresh water, and certain words are spoken, a Large water elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the bowl functions as the summon monster VI spell. Only one elemental can be called at a time. A new elemental requires the bowl to be filled with new water, which cannot happen until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).

When a charm is grasped and the name of the keyed individual is spoken, that person is called to the spot (a standard action) along with his or her gear, as long as the owner and the called person are on the same plane. The keyed individual knows who is calling, and the bracelet of friends only functions on willing travelers. Once a charm is activated, it disappears. Charms separated from the bracelet are worthless.

Simply burning the candle generates a favorable aura for the individual so doing if the candle's alignment matches that of the character. Characters of the same alignment as the burning candle add a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks while within 30 feet of the flame. A cleric whose alignment matches the candle's operates as if two levels higher for purposes of determining spells per day if he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation time. He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him, as if he were of that higher level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special cases (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours. In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast a gate spell, the respondent being of the same alignment as the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed in the process. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn't interfere with its magical properties. Strong conjuration; CL 17th

Censer of Controlling Air Elementals									TYPE:Magic.Wondrous			COST:100000	WT:1								
	SPROP:This 6-inch-wide, 1-inch-high perforated golden vessel resembles a thurible found in a place of worship. If it is filled with incense and lit, summoning words spoken over it summon forth a Large air elemental. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the censer functions as the summon monster VI spell. If incense of meditation is burned within the censer, the air elemental is an elder air elemental instead (as if summon monster IX had just been cast). Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new piece of incense, which cannot be lit until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain). See page 95 of the Monster Manual for details on air elementals. Strong conjuration; CL 17th

Chime of Opening													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous			COST:3000	WT:1		EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_10|CHARGES[10]	
	SPROP:A chime of opening is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or even an arcane lock cast by a wizard of lower than 15th level. The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck, a clear tone rings forth, and in 1 round the target lock is unlocked, the shackle is loosed, the secret door is opened, or the lid of the chest is lifted. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four uses of a chime of opening to get it open. A silence spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of ten times before it cracks and becomes useless. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th
