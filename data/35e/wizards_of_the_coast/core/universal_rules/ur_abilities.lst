###Block: Dragon Universal Rules
Crush	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Crush ~ Dragon			SOURCEPAGE:p.68	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:This special attack allows a flying or jumping dragon of at least Huge size to land on opponents as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon (though it can attempt normal overrun or grapple attacks against larger opponents). A crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under the dragon's body. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (round down). Grappling: Dragons do not favor grapple attacks, though their crush attack (and Snatch feat, if they know it) use normal grapple rules. A dragon can always use its breath weapon while grappling, as well as its spells and spell-like or supernatural abilities, provided it succeeds on Concentration checks.
Tail Sweep	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Tail Sweep ~ Dragon			SOURCEPAGE:p.68	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:This special attack allows a dragon of at least Gargantuan size to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending from an intersection on the edge of the dragon's space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are four or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon).
Breath Weapon	TYPE:Supernatural	KEY:Breath Weapon ~ Dragon		SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. If a dragon has more than one type of breath weapon, it still can breathe only once every 1d4 rounds. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at any intersection adjacent to the dragon and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice, with an area as noted on the table below. If the breath weapon deals damage, creatures caught in the area can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage; the DC depends on the dragon's age and variety, and is given in each individual entry. Saves against nondamaging breath weapons use the same DC; the kind of saving throw is noted in the variety descriptions. The save DC against a breath weapon is 10 + 1/2 dragon's HD + dragon's Con modifier. Breath weapons come in two basic shapes, line and cone, whose areas vary with the dragon's size.
Frightful Presence	TYPE:Extraordinary	KEY:Frightful Presence ~ Dragon	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet ? the dragon's age category are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragon. A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 dragon's HD + dragon's Cha modifier) remains immune to that dragon's frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or less HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.
Spells			KEY:Spells ~ Dragon			SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a sorcerer of the level indicated in its variety description, gaining bonus spells for a high Charisma score. Some dragons can also cast spells from the cleric list or cleric domain lists as arcane spells.
Spell-Like Abilities	KEY:Spell-Like Abilities ~ Dragon	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A dragon's spelllike abilities depend on its age and variety. It gains the abilities indicated for its age plus all previous ones. Its age category or its sorcerer caster level, whichever is higher, is the caster level for these abilities. The save DC is 10 + dragon's Cha modifier + spell level. All spell-like abilities are usable once per day unless otherwise noted.
Damage Reduction		KEY:Damage Reduction ~ Dragon		SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Young adult and older dragons have damage reduction. Their natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Immunities	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Immunities ~ Dragon			SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:All dragons have immunity to sleep and paralysis effects. Each variety of dragon has immunity to one or two additional forms of attack no matter what its age, as given in its description.
Spell Resistance	TYPE:Extraordinary	KEY:Spell Resistance ~ Dragon		SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:As dragons age, they become more resistant to spells and spell-like abilities, as indicated in the variety descriptions.
Blindsense	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Blindsense ~ Dragon			SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Dragons can pinpoint creatures within a distance of 60 feet. Opponents the dragon can't actually see still have total concealment against the dragon.

Skills			KEY:Skills ~ Dragon			SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:All dragons have skill points equal to (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) ? (Hit Dice + 3). Most dragons purchase the following skills at the maximum ranks possible: Listen, Search, and Spot. The remaining skill points are generally spent on Concentration, Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Intimidate, Knowledge (any), Sense Motive, and Use Magic Device at a cost of 1 skill point per rank. All these skills are considered class skills for dragons. (Each dragon has other class skills as well, as noted in the variety descriptions.)
Feats				KEY:Feats ~ Dragon			SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:All dragons have one feat, plus an additional feat per 3 Hit Dice, just like any other creature.
