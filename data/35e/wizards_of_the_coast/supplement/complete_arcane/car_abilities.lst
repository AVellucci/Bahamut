# Warlock
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Warlock ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarlockClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Warlocks are proficient with all simple weapons. They are proficient with light armor but not with shields. Because the somatic components required for warlock invocations are relatively simple, a warlock can use any of his invocations while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like arcane spellcasters, a warlock wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure (all invocations, including eldritch blast, have a somatic component). A multiclass warlock still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from levels in other classes.
Invocations	KEY:Warlock ~ Invocations	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarlockClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A warlock does not prepare or cast spells as other wielders of arcane magic do. Instead, he possesses a repertoire of attacks, defenses, and abilities known as invocations that require him to focus the wild energy that suffuses his soul. A warlock can use any invocation he knows at will, with the following qualifications: A warlock's invocations are spell-like abilities; using an invocation is therefore a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. An invocation can be disrupted, just as a spell can be ruined during casting. A warlock is entitled to a Concentration check to successfully use an invocation if he is hit by an attack while invoking, just as a spellcaster would be. A warlock can choose to use an invocation defensively, by making a successful Concentration check, to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity. A warlock's invocations are subject to spell resistance unless an invocation's description specifically states otherwise. A warlock's caster level with his invocations is equal to his warlock level. The save DC for an invocation (if it allows a save) is 10 + equivalent spell level + the warlock's Charisma modifier. Since spell-like abilities are not actually spells, a warlock cannot benefit from the Spell Focus feat. He can, however, benefit from the Ability Focus feat (see page 303 of the Monster Manual), as well as from feats that emulate metamagic effects for spell-like abilities, such as Quicken Spell-Like Ability and Empower Spell-Like Ability (see pages 303 and 304 of the Monster Manual). The four grades of invocations, in order of their relative power, are least, lesser, greater, and dark. A warlock begins with knowledge of one invocation, which must be of the lowest grade (least). As a warlock gains levels, he learns new invocations, as summarized on Table 1-1 and described below. A list of available invocations can be found following this class description, and a complete description of each invocation can be found in Chapter 4 of this book. At any level when a warlock learns a new invocation, he can also replace an invocation he already knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade. At 6th level, a warlock can replace a least invocation he knows with a different least invocation (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be either least or lesser). At 11th level, a warlock can replace a least or lesser invocation he knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be least, lesser, or greater). At 16th level, a warlock can replace a least, lesser, or greater invocation he knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be least, lesser, greater, or dark). Finally, unlike other spell-like abilities, invocations are subject to arcane spell failure chance as described under Weapon and Armor Proficiency above. Warlocks can qualify for some prestige classes usually intended for spellcasters; see Warlocks and Prestige Classes, page 18, for details.
Eldritch Blast (Sp)	KEY:Warlock ~ Eldritch Blast	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarlockClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The first ability a warlock learns is eldritch blast. A warlock attacks his foes with eldritch power, using baleful magical energy to deal damage and sometimes impart other debilitating effects. An eldritch blast is a ray with a range of 60 feet. It is a ranged touch attack that affects a single target, allowing no saving throw. An eldritch blast deals 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and increases in power as the warlock rises in level. An eldritch blast is the equivalent of a spell whose level is equal to one-half the warlock's class level (round down), with a minimum spell level of 1st and a maximum of 9th when a warlock reaches 18th level or higher. An eldritch blast is subject to spell resistance, although the Spell Penetration feat and other effects that improve caster level checks to overcome spell resistance also apply to eldritch blast. An eldritch blast deals half damage to objects. Metamagic feats cannot improve a warlock's eldritch blast (because it is a spell-like ability, not a spell). However, the feat Ability Focus (eldritch blast) increases the DC for all saving throws (if any) associated with a warlock's eldritch blast by 2. See page 303 of the Monster Manual.
Detect Magic (Sp)	KEY:Warlock ~ Detect Magic	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarlockClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a warlock can use detect magic as the spell at will. His caster level equals his class level.
Damage Reduction (Su)	KEY:Warlock ~ Damage Reduction	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarlockClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Fortified by the supernatural power flowing in his body, a warlock becomes resistant to physical attacks at 3rd level and above, gaining damage reduction 1/cold iron. At 7th level and every four levels thereafter, a warlock's damage reduction improves as shown on Table 1-1.
Deceive Item (Ex)	KEY:Warlock ~ Deceive Item	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarlockClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level and higher, a warlock has the ability to more easily commandeer magic items made for the use of other characters. When making a Use Magic Device check, a warlock can take 10 even if distracted or threatened.
Fiendish Resilience (Su)	KEY:Warlock ~ Fiendish Resilience	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarlockClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 8th level, a warlock knows the trick of fiendish resilience. Once per day, as a free action, he can enter a state that lasts for 2 minutes. While in this state, the warlock gains fast healing 1. At 13th level, a warlock's fiendish resilience improves. When in his fiendish resilience state, he gains fast healing 2 instead. At 18th level, a warlock's fiendish resilience improves to fast healing 5.
Energy Resistance (Su)	KEY:Warlock ~ Energy Resistance	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarlockClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level and higher, a warlock has resistance 5 against any two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic. Once the types are chosen, this energy resistance cannot be changed. At 20th level, a warlock gains resistance 10 against the two selected types of energy.
Imbue Item (Su)	KEY:Warlock ~ Imbue Item	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarlockClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A warlock of 12th level or higher can use his supernatural power to create magic items, even if he does not know the spells required to make an item (although he must know the appropriate item creation feat). He can substitute a Use Magic Device check (DC 15 + spell level for arcane spells or 25 + spell level for divine spells) in place of a required spell he doesn't know or can't cast. If the check succeeds, the warlock can create the item as if he had cast the required spell. If it fails, he cannot complete the item. He does not expend the XP or gp costs for making the item; his progress is simply arrested. He cannot retry this Use Magic Device check for that spell until he gains a new level.

# Warmage
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Warmage ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarmageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Warmages are profi- cient with all simple weapons, light armor, and light shields. At 8th level, a warmage gains proficiency with medium armor (see Armored Mage, below).
Spells	KEY:Warmage ~ Spells	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarmageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A warmage casts arcane spells (the same type of spells available to sorcerers and wizards), which are drawn from the warmage spell list given below. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time the way a cleric or wizard must. When a warmage gains access to a new level of spells, he automatically knows all the spells for that level listed on the warmage's spell list. Essentially, his spell list is the same as his spells known list. Warmages also have the option of adding to their existing spell list through their advanced learning ability as they increase in level (see below). See page 90 for the warmage's spell list. To cast a spell, a warmage must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1stlevel spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a warmage's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the warmage's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, a warmage can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-1: The Warmage. In addition, he receives bonus spells for a high Charisma score (see Table 1-1, page 8 of the Player's Handbook). Unlike a cleric or a wizard, a warmage need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level.
Armored Mage (Ex)	KEY:Warmage ~ Armored Mage	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarmageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Normally, armor of any type interferes with an arcane spellcaster's gestures, which can cause his spells to fail (if those spells have somatic components). A warmage's limited focus and specialized training, however, allows him to avoid arcane spell failure as long as he sticks to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to medium or heavier armors, nor to heavy shields. Nor does this ability apply to spells gained from a different spellcasting class. At 8th level, a warmage learns to use medium armor with no chance of arcane spell failure.
Warmage Edge (Ex)	KEY:Warmage ~ Warmage Edge	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarmageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A warmage is specialized in dealing damage with his spells. Whenever a warmage casts a spell that deals hit point damage, he adds his Intelligence bonus (if any) to the amount of damage dealt. For instance, if a 1st-level warmage with 17 Intelligence casts magic missile, he deals 1d4+1 points of damage normally, plus an extra 3 points of damage due to his Intelligence bonus. The bonus from the warmage edge special ability applies only to spells that he casts as a warmage, not to those he might have by virtue of levels in another class. A single spell can never gain this extra damage more than once per casting. For instance, a fireball deals the extra damage to all creatures in the area it affects. However, if a 3rd-level warmage casts magic missile and produces two missiles, only one of them (of the warmage's choice) gains the extra damage, even if both missiles are directed at the same target. If a spell deals damage for more than 1 round, it deals this extra damage in each round. Scrolls scribed by a warmage do not gain any benefit from warmage edge. Scrolls activated by a warmage also gain no benefit from warmage edge. The same is true for most other magic items, such as wands and potions. However, staffs activated by a warmage use not only the warmage's caster level but also gain the benefits of the warmage edge, if applicable.
Advanced Learning (Ex)	KEY:Warmage ~ Advanced Learning	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarmageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 16th level, a warmage can add a new spell to his list, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a wizard spell of the evocation school, and of a level no higher than that of the highest-level spell the warmage already knows. Once a new spell is selected, it is forever added to that warmage's spell list and can be cast just like any other spell on the warmage's list.
Sudden Empower	KEY:Warmage ~ Sudden Empower	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarmageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level, a warmage gains Sudden Empower (described in Chapter 3) as a bonus feat. If he already has the feat, he can choose a different metamagic feat.
Sudden Enlarge	KEY:Warmage ~ Sudden Enlarge	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarmageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, a warmage gains Sudden Enlarge (described in Chapter 3) as a bonus feat. If he already has the feat, he can choose a different metamagic feat.
Sudden Widen	KEY:Warmage ~ Sudden Widen	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarmageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 15th level, a warmage gains Sudden Widen (described in Chapter 3) as a bonus feat. If he already has the feat, he can choose a different metamagic feat.
Sudden Maximize	KEY:Warmage ~ Sudden Maximize	SOURCEPAGE:p.14	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.WarmageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 20th level, a warmage gains Sudden Maximize (described in Chapter 3) as a bonus feat. If he already has the feat, he can choose a different metamagic feat.

# Wu Jen
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Wu Jen ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wu JenClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Wu jen are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a wu jen's arcane gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.
Spells	KEY:Wu Jen ~ Spells	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wu JenClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A wu jen casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the wu jen spell list (page 91). She is limited to a certain number of spells of each spell level per day, according to her class level. A wu jen must choose and prepare spells ahead of time like a wizard (see Preparing Wizard Spells, page 177 of the Player's Handbook). To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, a wu jen must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell's level. A wu jen's bonus spells are based on Intelligence. The Difficulty Class for saving throws against wu jen spells is 10 + the spell's level + the wu jen's Intelligence modifier. A wu jen's base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-3. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the Player's Handbook).
Bonus Languages	KEY:Wu Jen ~ Bonus Languages	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wu JenClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A wu jen can substitute Draconic or Giant for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of her race, since many ancient tomes of magic are written in these languages and apprentice wu jen often learn them as part of their studies.
Watchful Spirit	KEY:Wu Jen ~ Watchful Spirit	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wu JenClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Once per day, a wu jen can reroll an initiative roll she has just made before she knows her place in the initiative order. She takes the better of the two rolls.
Bonus Feat	KEY:Wu Jen ~ Bonus Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wu JenClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A wu jen begins play with a bonus metamagic feat.
Spell Secret	KEY:Wu Jen ~ Spell Secret	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wu JenClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a wu jen can choose one spell known to her that then becomes permanently modified as though affected by one of the following metamagic feats: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Still Spell, or Silent Spell. The spell's level does not change, and once the choice of spell and modification are chosen, they cannot be changed. As the wu jen goes up in level, she can choose the same spell to be modified in different ways with multiple spell secrets. She does not need to know the feat she applies to the spell.
Elemental Mastery	KEY:Wu Jen ~ Elemental Mastery	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wu JenClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Many of the wu jen's spells are divided into five elemental groups: earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. At 6th level, instead of receiving a spell secret, a wu jen becomes a master of one of these five elements (her choice). Thereafter, whenever a wu jen casts a spell of that element, her effective caster level (for purposes of determining level-dependent spell variables and for caster level checks) is increased by two. In addition, the wu jen herself gets a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against spells of that element. Certain spells on the wu jen spell list are designated "All"; this means they belong to all elemental groups, and a wu jen who is a master of any element gains the mastery bonuses with respect to those spells.
Spellbooks	KEY:Wu Jen ~ Spellbooks	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wu JenClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A wu jen must study her spellbooks each day to prepare her spells, much like a wizard. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook (except for read magic, which all wu jen can prepare from memory). A wu jen begins play with a spellbook containing all 0- level wu jen spells plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wu jen has (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the Player's Handbook), the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wu jen level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wu jen level). For example, when Hide-yori achieves 5th level, she can cast 3rd-level spells. At this point, she can add two 3rd-level spells to her spellbook, or one 2nd-level spell and one 3rd-level spell, or any combination of two spells between 1st and 3rd level. At any time, a wu jen can also add spells found in other wu jen's spellbooks to her own, much like a wizard (see Adding Spells to a Wizard's Spellbook, page 178 of the Player's Handbook).
Taboos	KEY:Wu Jen ~ Taboos	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wu JenClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:To maintain their supernatural power, wu jen must abide by certain taboos that might seem inconsequential to other characters but are vitally important to the wu jen. If a wu jen violates one of her taboos, she cannot cast any more spells that day. A wu jen must choose one taboo at 1st level, and one additional taboo every time she learns a spell secret. Possible taboos include: . Cannot eat meat. . Cannot own more than she can carry. . Must make a daily offering (such as food, flowers, or incense) to one or many spirit powers. . Cannot bathe. . Cannot cut her hair. . Cannot touch a dead body. . Cannot drink alcohol. . Cannot wear a certain color. . Cannot light a fire. . Cannot sit facing in a certain direction.

Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known	SOURCEPAGE:p.19	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Acolyte of the SkinClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At each even-numbered level, an acolyte of the skin gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, a bonus feat, and so on). If he had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an acolyte of the skin, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

The bonded endish skin is for all intents and purposes the character's own. It increases the acolyte of the skin's natural armor bonus by 1 and grants a +2 inherent bonus to Dexterity. The acolyte also gains darkvision out to 60 feet. The DM determines the actual nature of the skin, be it demonic, devilish, or from some other fiendish creature.
Poison (Sp)	KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Poison	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Acolyte of the SkinClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An acolyte of the skin can use poison once per day as an 8th-level caster. The save DC is 14 + the acolyte's primary spellcasting ability modifier (Intelligence for wizards, Charisma for sorcerers and warlocks, Wisdom for clerics, and so forth). At 5th level, an acolyte can use this ability two times per day.
Flame Resistant (Ex)	KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Flame Resistant	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Acolyte of the SkinClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level and higher, the fiendish skin binds more tightly, granting an acolyte resistance to fire 10.
Fiendish Glare (Su)	KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Fiendish Glare	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Acolyte of the SkinClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:From 3rd level on, an acolyte of the skin has the supernatural ability to unnerve opponents with a ferocious glare once per day. This is not a gaze attack, and the target need not meet the acolyte's eyes or even see the acolyte (although the acolyte must have line of effect to the target). Glaring is a standard action that affects any creature the acolyte can see within 100 feet. The target becomes shaken for 10 minutes, and must also attempt a Will save (DC 10 + acolyte's class level + Cha modifier) or be stunned. The duration of the stun effect depends on the target's hit points: 50 or less 10 rounds 51 to 100 3 rounds 101 to 150 2 rounds 151 or more 1 round Fiendish glare is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Skin Adaptation (Su)	KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Skin Adaptation	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Acolyte of the SkinClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:By 5th level, an acolyte's skin and its wearer have grown more comfortable together, as if they had never been separate. The increase to natural armor granted by the fiendish skin improves to +2, the acolyte gains a +2 inherent bonus to Constitution, and the acolyte's darkvision is effective out to 120 feet.
Cold Resistant (Ex)	KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Cold Resistant	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Acolyte of the SkinClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 6th level, an acolyte has resistance to cold 10.
Glare of the Pit (Su)	KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Glare of the Pit	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Acolyte of the SkinClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level and higher, an acolyte has the supernatural ability to produce fiery rays from his eyes. Once per day as a standard action, he can project two rays (one from each eye) with a range of 100 feet. Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 8d6 points of fire damage. The rays can be aimed at two different targets within range, but the target of each ray must be designated simultaneously.
Summon Fiend (Sp)	KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Summon Fiend	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Acolyte of the SkinClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 9th level, an acolyte learns to draw on another power of his fiendish skin. If the skin is demonic, once per day he can summon a babau; if devilish, once per day he can summon a chain devil. The summoned creature does the acolyte's bidding, but it automatically returns whence it came after 1 hour. A summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning abilities it might have. An acolyte's caster level for this ability is equal to his spellcaster level.
Fiendish Symbiosis (Ex)	KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Fiendish Symbiosis	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Acolyte of the SkinClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, the fiendish skin and acolyte become one, and only final death can separate them. The acolyte's type changes to outsider. Additionally, an acolyte of this level gains damage reduction 10/good. Unlike other outsiders, an acolyte can be raised or resurrected.

# Alienist
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Alienist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.21	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.AlienistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Alienists gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Alienist ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.AlienistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At each level, an alienist gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, a bonus feat, and so on). If she had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an alienist, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Familiar Abilities	KEY:Alienist ~ Familiar Abilities	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.AlienistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Levels of alienist stack with levels of any class that provide access to a familiar. Add levels from this class and the class that granted access to the familiar together and refer to the table on page 53 of the Player's Handbook to determine the familiar's natural armor, Intelligence, and special abilities. If a character had levels in multiple classes that grant access to a familiar before becoming an alienist, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining the abilities of her familiar. This ability does not grant an alienist a familiar if she does not already have one.
Summon Alien	KEY:Alienist ~ Summon Alien	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.AlienistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Whenever an alienist would use any summon monster spell to summon a celestial or fiendish creature, she instead summons a pseudonatural version of that creature. For example, by casting summon monster IV, she could summon a pseudonatural dire wolf. This adds the pseudonatural template (see page 160) to the summoned creature. An alienist gives up the ability to summon nonpseudonatural creatures with a summon monster spell. For instance, the alienist described above couldn't summon a mephit or howler with summon monster IV.
Alien Blessing (Ex)	KEY:Alienist ~ Alien Blessing	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.AlienistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An alienist who attains 2nd level gains a +1 insight bonus on all saving throws, but she permanently loses 2 points of Wisdom.
Metamagic Secret	KEY:Alienist ~ Metamagic Secret	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.AlienistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An alienist listens to the secret voices whispering from beyond time's end, and profits thereby. At 3rd and again at 7th level, she can choose any metamagic feat as a bonus feat.
Mad Certainty (Ex)	KEY:Alienist ~ Mad Certainty	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.AlienistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level, an alienist's mad certainty in the power of entities beyond the reach of normal space and time lend her an unnatural fortitude, granting her an additional 3 hit points. However, constantly dwelling on such beings is mentally corrosive, and the alienist's mind begins to fracture. She now takes a -4 penalty on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Handle Animal checks made to influence nonpseudonatural creatures.
Pseudonatural Familiar	KEY:Alienist ~ Pseudonatural Familiar	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.AlienistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 5th level, an alienist's familiar, if any, gains the pseudonatural template (see page 160) in addition to the powers and abilities normal for a familiar of the appropriate level. This effect does not replace an existing familiar-the familiar has been slowly taking on pseudonatural aspects as the alienist rises in level, and those characteristics become fully functional at this point. From now on, the alienist's newly summoned familiars already possess the pseudonatural template. If an alienist has no familiar, this ability has no effect.
Extra Summoning	KEY:Alienist ~ Extra Summoning	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.AlienistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:From 6th level on, an alienist gains one extra spell slot at her highest spell level. This slot can be used only for a summon monster spell. As an alienist becomes able to learn higher-level spells, the extra slot migrates up to the new highest level.
Insane Certainty (Ex)	KEY:Alienist ~ Insane Certainty	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.AlienistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 8th level, an alienist's mad certainty crystallizes into a truly chilling mania. She gains an additional 3 hit points, but her mental faculties continue to degrade. Her penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Handle Animal checks made to influence nonpseudonatural creatures increases to -10.
Timeless Body (Ex)	KEY:Alienist ~ Timeless Body	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.AlienistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 9th level, an alienist learns the secret of perpetual youth. She no longer takes ability penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged (see Table 6-5, page 109 of the Player's Handbook). Ability score bonuses from aging still accrue, and any penalties the alienist might have already taken remain in place. An alienist is stolen away by horrible entities when her time is up, and she is never seen again.
Alien Transcendence (Su)	KEY:Alienist ~ Alien Transcendence	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.AlienistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 10th-level alienist, because of long association with alien entities and intense study of insane secrets, transcends her mortal form and becomes an alien creature. Her type changes to outsider. Additionally, she gains damage reduction 10/magic and resistance to acid 10 and electricity 10. Upon achieving alien transcendence, an alienist undergoes a minor physical change, usually growing a small tentacle or other strange feature, such as an extra appendage, organ, eye, or enigmatic lump. An alienist can hide this abnormality in a robe or hood, but the alien growth is not under the alienist's control and sometimes moves, twitches, opens, or otherwise animates of its own accord. This applies a -4 penalty on Disguise checks an alienist makes to conceal her true nature. Anyone who shares an alienist's predilection for study of the Far Realms immediately recognizes her transcendent nature, and she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on all Charisma- based skill checks and ability checks when interacting with such beings. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks involving any other creatures to whom she reveals her abnormal nature.

# Argent Savant
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Argent Savant ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Argent SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Argent savants gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Argent Savant ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Argent SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At each level after 1st, an argent savant gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If she had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an argent savant, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Force Specialization	KEY:Argent Savant ~ Force Specialization	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Argent SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An argent savant gains a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls made with her force spells. She also adds a +1 bonus to each die of damage dealt by spells she casts with the force descriptor. If the force spell doesn't deal damage expressed by dice, she adds only a +1 bonus to the total damage dealt. For example, a magic missile cast by a 9th-level wizard/1stlevel argent savant deals 1d4+2 points of damage per missile. A 9th-level wizard/4th-level argent savant deals 4d6+7 points of force damage with her Mordenkainen's sword spell.
Force Armor (Ex)	KEY:Argent Savant ~ Force Armor	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Argent SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level and higher, an argent savant gains more benefit from defensive force spells than other characters. If she casts a force spell that provides an armor bonus or a shield bonus to Armor Class, she increases the spell's normal armor bonus by 2. For example, mage armor normally adds an armor bonus of +4 to the caster's AC, but an argent savant with this ability who casts mage armor adds an armor bonus of +6 to her AC.
Enduring Force (Ex)	KEY:Argent Savant ~ Enduring Force	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Argent SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Force spells cast by an argent savant of 3rd level or higher linger longer than normal, and they are more difficult to counter or dispel. The duration of a force spell cast by the savant is doubled, as if the Extend Spell feat had been applied to it. However, the spell's level and casting time are unchanged. The same restrictions that apply to extended spells apply to spells affected by enduring force. In addition, the DC required to counter or dispel the argent savant's force spells increases by 4.
Ablate Force (Ex)	KEY:Argent Savant ~ Ablate Force	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Argent SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Due to her improved understanding of magical force, an argent savant of 4th level or higher can prevent force damage to herself. She subtracts her class level from damage dealt by any force spell or effect. A force spell producing multiple attacks, such as magic missile, is considered a single attack for this purpose; deduct the savant's level from the total damage dealt by the spell, not the damage dealt by each individual missile.
Unbind Force (Su)	KEY:Argent Savant ~ Unbind Force	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Argent SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, an argent savant learns how to unweave a force spell or effect and liberate its magical energy. As a standard action, she can attempt to dispel a single force spell or effect within 60 feet (even those normally immune to dispel magic, such as wall of force). If she succeeds on a caster level check (DC 11 + opposing caster's level), the force effect is unbound. This immediately dispels the effect and deals 1d6 points of force damage per level of the dispelled spell to all creatures and objects within 10 feet of the unbound spell. For example, if an argent savant unbound another caster's wall of force, the liberated spell energy would deal 5d6 points of force damage to anyone within 10 feet of the wall's former location.

# Blood Magus
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Blood magi gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At each level except 5th and 10th, a blood magus gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a blood magus, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Blood Component (Su)	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Blood Component	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A blood magus can substitute a drop of his own blood for a spell's material components, if any, and in so doing increase the spell's power. The pinprick or minor knife cut to draw the requisite blood is a free action (just like using material components) that becomes a normal part of casting the spell. Using this ability deals 1 point of damage to the blood magus but raises the spell's caster level by 1. Damage reduction, if the character has any, doesn't apply to this damage. If a spell has a costly material component (greater than 1 gp), the component must still be provided. If a spell has no material component, a blood magus can still use this ability to enhance a spell if he desires.
Durable Casting (Ex)	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Durable Casting	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A blood magus has a knack for being able to concentrate on casting spells and maintaining them despite taking damage while doing so. For the purpose of making a Concentration check to cast, concentrate on, or direct a spell when he might be distracted by damage, a blood magus subtracts his level from any hit point damage dealt to him by an attack that strikes him during the action (or whenever he is subject to a source of continuous damage, such as Melf's acid arrow). A blood magus still takes all the damage dealt to him, but the damage is less likely to affect his ability to cast, concentrate on, or direct spells successfully. For example, a 1st-level blood magus can "ignore" 1 point of damage from each source that damages him while casting a spell for the purpose of determining the DC of his Concentration check to cast successfully. If struck for 5 points of damage while casting a spell, he must make a Concentration check to successfully cast, but the DC is only 10 + 4 (damage dealt minus 1) + the spell's level. A 5th-level blood magus could ignore up to 5 points of damage dealt from each source that damages him during casting (and thus wouldn't have to make a Concentration check if struck for 5 points of damage or less). Because of this ability, damage a blood magus takes from using his blood component and bloodseeking spell special abilities never requires him to make a Concentration check to finish the spell he is casting.
Stanch (Ex)	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Stanch	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A blood magus automatically becomes stable when his hit points drop below 0. He still dies if he reaches -10 hit points or lower.
Scarification (Ex)	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Scarification	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a blood magus can inscribe spells on his own skin for later use. This process involves deeply scratching the skin (which deals no damage but often leaves scars). The scratches remain fresh until the inscribed spell is cast, at which time the wound heals normally. Effectively, a blood magus gains the Scribe Scroll feat (see page 99 of the Player's Handbook) using an alternative medium. All rules, XP costs, and expenses that apply to Scribe Scroll also apply to this ability. Likewise, "reading" a scar follows the same rules as reading a scroll, but only a blood magus can decipher his own scars. One's own skin leaves a limited amount of room to easily inscribe and "read" magical scars. Thus, a blood magus can have only six of these scars at any one time.
Death Knell (Sp)	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Death Knell	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, a blood magus has the ability to use death knell as the spell once per day.
Blood Draught (Ex)	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Blood Draught	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level, a blood magus learns how to store spells of up to 3rd level in his own blood. Effectively, he gains the Brew Potion feat (see page 89 of the Player's Handbook) using an alternative medium. All rules, XP costs, and expenses that apply to Brew Potion also apply to this ability, with the following exceptions. Once "brewed," a blood draught remains in circulation within a magus's body. The maximum number of draughts he can store at one time is equal to his blood magus level + his Con score, but if he is ever slain, they are all immediately ruined-even if he is subsequently returned to life. Blood draughts are never accidentally lost through major blood loss or by a blood-draining attack. To consume a draught, a blood magus pricks his skin, automatically bringing forth the desired effect. This is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, like drinking a potion. Another individual can partake of a blood draught (if he or she has a strong stomach) by drinking 1 ounce of the blood magus's blood as a full-round action. The blood magus must have an open wound to share the effects of a blood draught with another creature; if he lacks one, the creature can inflict a wound that deals 1 point of damage to the blood magus as part of the action to consume the draught. A blood magus cannot store his blood in a container to share at a later time. The blood draught must be drawn fresh from his body, or it loses potency within 1 round.
Homunculus (Su)	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Homunculus	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:From 5th level on, a blood magus can use his blood to give life to a new companion creature-a homunculus (see page 154 of the Monster Manual). A blood magus need not meet any of the given prerequisites to create the homunculus; however, a blood magus must permanently sacrifice 1 hit point as part of the creation process. The process requires 1 hour. A blood magus enjoys a stronger than normal link with his homunculus. By touching the homunculus, a blood magus can transfer his wounds to the creature (up to 1 hp per level with each touch). This is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Each time a blood magus gains a class level, his homunculus advances 1 Hit Die, as described on page 290 of the Monster Manual, and it gains all the normal benefits of its increased Hit Dice (increased base attack bonus, saves, and so on). The homunculus advances to a maximum of 6 Hit Dice when the blood magus reaches 9th level. If his homunculus is destroyed, a blood magus takes 2d10 points of damage, as noted in the Monster Manual. A blood magus's death results in the death of his homunculus. A blood magus can have only one homunculus at any given time.
Bloodseeking Spell (Su)	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Bloodseeking Spell	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 6th level, a blood magus can imbue his spells with the ability to draw blood from their targets. To use this ability, a blood magus must inflict a wound on himself; this is a free action that deals 3 points of damage to the blood magus and becomes a normal part of casting the spell. Damage reduction, if a blood magus has any, doesn't apply to this damage. A bloodseeking spell deals an extra 1d6 points of damage to each target that takes damage from the spell. This extra damage applies only to spells that deal hit point damage, not to spells that deal ability damage, ability drain, or other kinds of damage. Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and any creatures without blood or a similar substance within their bodies are immune to this effect.
Thicker Than Water (Su)	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Thicker Than Water	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level and higher, a blood magus's vital fluids are partially under his control. When a blood magus is injured, his blood withdraws from the wound, avoiding some damage that he would otherwise take. This ability gives the blood magus damage reduction 1/bludgeoning.
Awaken Blood (Su)	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Awaken Blood	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 8th level and higher, a blood magus can bestow momentary consciousness on an opponent's blood. If he hits a foe with a melee touch attack, the opponent's blood tries to get free of its confinement-all at once. The pressure disrupts the victim's tissues, dealing 10d10 points of damage. This ability is usable only once per day, but a blood magus can try to use it again later in the day if his previous attempt failed. The effect is instantaneous. Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and any creatures without blood or a similar substance within their bodies are immune to this effect.
Infusion (Ex)	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Infusion	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Upon reaching 9th level, a blood magus prepares a special one-time distillation of his own blood. After partaking of the infusion, he gains a 2-point increase to his Constitution score.
Bloodwalk (Su)	KEY:Blood Magus ~ Bloodwalk	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Blood MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, a blood magus becomes perfectly attuned to the song of blood. He gains the supernatural ability to transport himself great distances via the blood of living creatures. Once per day as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, he can seamlessly enter any living creature (except an elemental, ooze, plant, undead, or other creature without blood or a similar fluid) whose size equals or exceeds his own and pass any distance to another living creature on the same plane in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two. A blood magus merely designates a direction and distance ("a living creature twenty miles due west of here"), and the bloodwalk ability transports him to a destination creature as close as possible to the desired location. He can't specify a named individual as the endpoint unless he has previously obtained a sample of that creature's blood and has it preserved in a vial that he carries. The entry and destination creatures need not be familiar to the blood magus. A blood magus cannot use himself as an entry creature. If an intended entry creature is unwilling, he must make a successful melee touch attack to enter. (A missed touch attack does not use up the ability for that day.) When exiting a creature, a blood magus chooses an adjacent square in which to appear. Entering and exiting a creature is painless unless a blood magus wishes otherwise (see below). In most cases, though, the destination creature finds being the endpoint of a magical portal surprising and quite unsettling. If he desires, a blood magus can attempt to make a bloody exit from the destination creature. He bursts forth explosively from the creature's body, dealing 10d6 points of damage unless the creature makes a Fortitude save (DC 10 + blood magus's class level + blood magus's Con modifier). When he makes a bloody exit, a blood magus must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round from the shock of his expulsion.

# Effigy Master

Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Effigy Master ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Effigy MasterClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At each class level after 1st, an effigy master gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, a bonus feat, and so on). If he had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an effigy master, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Craft Effigy (Su)	KEY:Effigy Master ~ Craft Effigy	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Effigy MasterClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An effigy master can create constructs known as effigies (see page 151). Unlike other creators, he need not possess the Craft Construct feat to complete this task, nor does he need the feat or ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering) to repair an effigy he creates (see page 151 for details on repairing an effigy). An effigy master can add his class level to his caster level to determine the maximum Hit Dice of effigy that he can create. Crafting an effigy requires a body to be built from wood, leather, metal, and wire. This requires a DC 15 Craft (woodworking, leatherworking, or metalworking) check. The gp and XP required to create the effigy depends on its size, as described on page 155.
Improved Effigy (Ex)	KEY:Effigy Master ~ Improved Effigy	SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Effigy MasterClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An effigy master of 3rd level or higher can improve upon his creations, granting them a permanent +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, damage, and saves. This requires one day of work and costs 100 gp of supplies per Hit Die of the effigy to be improved, but has no XP cost.
Effigy Link (Su)	KEY:Effigy Master ~ Effigy Link	SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Effigy MasterClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level and higher, an effigy master can create a supernatural bond between himself and one of his effigies. This requires a 1-hour ritual. Afterward, the effigy master can sense the effigy's condition (as if he had cast status on the effigy), and can scry on the effigy (as if casting the scrying spell) once per day. Furthermore, an effigy master gains a +1 morale bonus on saving throws and caster level checks as long as he is within 5 feet of his bonded effigy. An effigy master can be linked to only one effigy at any time. If the linked effigy is destroyed, or if the effigy master wants to establish a new link, he can create a link to another effigy (and eliminate the old link) by performing the ritual with the new effigy.

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, a bonus feat, and so on). If she had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an elemental savant, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Elemental Specialty (Ex)	KEY:Elemental Savant ~ Elemental Specialty	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Elemental SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The first step toward transcending mortal form requires an elemental savant to choose her elemental specialty. Upon entering the class, she must select an element and its associated energy type (air = electricity, earth = acid, fire = fire, or water = cold). This choice must match the Energy Substitution feat that the savant selected to gain entry to the prestige class. When the savant casts a spell that normally deals energy damage, its energy descriptor changes to the savant's chosen energy type, and it deals damage of that energy type instead of its normal energy type. For example, an elemental savant choosing to specialize in fire could still cast meld into stone, and its descriptor would not change because it does not deal energy damage. However, if she casts Melf's acid arrow, the spell would deal fire damage and have the fire descriptor instead of dealing acid damage and having the acid descriptor.
Resistance to Energy (Ex)	KEY:Elemental Savant ~ Resistance to Energy	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Elemental SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As an elemental savant gains levels in this prestige class, she becomes more resistant to the type of energy allied with her chosen element. At 1st level, she gains resistance 5 against this energy type. This resistance rises to 10 at 4th level and 20 at 7th level.
Immunity to Sleep (Ex)	KEY:Elemental Savant ~ Immunity to Sleep	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Elemental SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, as an elemental savant continues to transcend her mortal form, she gains immunity to sleep effects.
Energy Penetration (Ex)	KEY:Elemental Savant ~ Energy Penetration	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Elemental SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, an elemental savant further refines her ability to wield energy associated with her chosen element. When she casts a spell using that type of energy, she gains a +2 competence bonus on caster level checks (1d20 + caster level) to overcome a creature's spell resistance. At 8th level, this bonus increases to +4. These bonuses stack with those granted by the Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration feats.
Energy Focus (Ex)	KEY:Elemental Savant ~ Energy Focus	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Elemental SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:From 5th level on, an elemental savant is better able to manipulate energy associated with her chosen element. The save DC for any spell with that energy descriptor increases by 1. At 10th level, these save DCs increase by 1 again (total increase of 2). These increases are cumulative with those granted by the Spell Focus and Greater Spell Focus feats.
Darkvision (Ex)	KEY:Elemental Savant ~ Darkvision	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Elemental SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 6th level, an elemental savant gains darkvision out to 60 feet.
Immunity to Paralysis and Poison (Ex)	KEY:Elemental Savant ~ Immunity to Paralysis and Poison	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Elemental SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As an elemental savant approaches elemental perfection, she gains immunity to paralysis and poison at 9th level.
Elemental Perfection	KEY:Elemental Savant ~ Elemental Perfection	SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Elemental SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, an elemental savant, through long association with elemental entities and extensive study of their secrets, completely transcends her mortal form to become an elemental creature. Her type changes to elemental. She no longer needs to eat, sleep, or breathe (though she must still rest to regain spells). She gains an elemental creature's immunity to stunning, and she is no longer subject to extra damage from critical hits or flanking. An elemental savant gains the speed and movement modes, natural attacks, special attacks, and special qualities of a Medium elemental of the type appropriate to her elemental specialty, as noted in the Monster Manual, except that the save DC against her elemental attack form, if any (whirlwind, burn, or vortex) is 20 + her Con modifier. Upon achieving this state, an elemental savant's appearance undergoes a minor physical change, usually to the skin or eyes. An earth elemental savant, for example, might acquire gemlike eyes and hard, pebbly skin. Anyone who shares the elemental savant's predilection for study of her chosen plane immediately recognizes her transcendent nature. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on all Charisma-based skill and ability checks when interacting with creatures that share her elemental subtype (air, earth, fire, or water) and with other elemental savants who have chosen her element. Unlike a normal elemental, an elemental savant retains a soul separate from her body. She can be raised from the dead as normal for a creature of her previous type.
Energy Immunity (Ex)	KEY:Elemental Savant ~ Energy Immunity	SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Elemental SavantClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:From 10th level on, an elemental savant gains immunity to the type of energy associated with her chosen element.

# Enlightened Fist

Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Enlightened Fist ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known	SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Enlightened FistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Except at 1st level and 6th level, an enlightened fist gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If she had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an enlightened fist, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Ki Strike (Su)	KEY:Enlightened Fist ~ Ki Strike	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Enlightened FistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An enlightened fist's unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction.
Monk Abilities	KEY:Enlightened Fist ~ Monk Abilities	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Enlightened FistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An enlightened fist adds her class level to her monk level to determine her class-based AC bonus, her unarmed damage, her unarmored speed bonus, and the number of daily attempts of her Stunning Fist feat. If she has no monk levels, she gains the AC bonus, unarmed damage, and unarmored speed bonus of a monk whose level equals her enlightened fist level, but she can't add her Wisdom bonus to her AC. An enlightened fist does not count her class levels for the purpose of determining when she gains any other monk class features, such as reduced penalties for flurry of blows attack rolls, bonus feats, evasion, or other special abilities.
Fist of Energy (Su)	KEY:Enlightened Fist ~ Fist of Energy	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Enlightened FistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Once per round as a free action, an enlightened fist of 2nd level or higher can spend one of her daily stunning attempts to imbue her unarmed strikes with either electricity or fire. The enlightened fist chooses the energy type each time she activates. For 1 round, each of her unarmed strike that hits deals an extra 1d6 points of damage (electricity or fire, depending on the choice). At 6th level and higher, an enlightened fist can cause her energy-imbued unarmed strikes to burst with flame or lightning on a critical hit. In addition to dealing an extra 1d6 points of energy damage, her unarmed attacks deal an extra 1d10 points of energy damage on a successful critical hit. If the enlightened fist's unarmed critical multiplier is ?3, she adds an extra 2d10 points of energy damage instead, and if the multiplier is ?4, she adds an extra 3d10 points of energy damage. An enlightened fist with monk levels can use this ability to channel energy through wielded monk weapons just as she can through her unarmed attacks.
Arcane Fist (Su)	KEY:Enlightened Fist ~ Arcane Fist	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Enlightened FistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, an enlightened fist can spend one of her daily stunning attempts to cast and deliver a touch spell as part of an unarmed full attack action. She can choose to deliver the touch spell with any single unarmed strike attack she makes during the action.
Arcane Rejuvenation (Su)	KEY:Enlightened Fist ~ Arcane Rejuvenation	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Enlightened FistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An enlightened fist of 5th level or higher can channel arcane energy to heal her own wounds. As a standard action, she can sacrifice one of her prepared spells or unused spell slots; doing this heals a number of hit points of damage equal to the spell's level.
Hold Ray (Ex)	KEY:Enlightened Fist ~ Hold Ray	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Enlightened FistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level or higher, an enlightened fist can cast any spell that produces a ray effect as a touch spell instead. The spell's range is reduced to touch, and its Effect entry is replaced with "Target: Creature touched." She can deliver the spell with a touch attack or with a normal attack, and she can hold the charge as with a normal touch spell. An enlightened fist can combine this ability with arcane fist (see above) to deliver a ray-effect spell as part of an unarmed full attack action.
Diamond Soul (Ex)	KEY:Enlightened Fist ~ Diamond Soul	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Enlightened FistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 9th level, an enlightened fist gains spell resistance equal to 10 + the total of her monk levels and enlightened fist levels .
Multiclassing Note	KEY:Enlightened Fist ~ Multiclassing Note	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Enlightened FistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A monk who becomes an enlightened fist can continue advancing as a monk. Furthermore, the character's class levels in any classes that grant arcane spellcasting ability (such as sorcerer or warmage) do not prevent her from continuing to advance as a monk.

# Fatespinner
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Fatespinner ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.FatespinnerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Fatespinners gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Fatespinner ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known	SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.FatespinnerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At each level except 5th, a fatespinner gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, a bonus feat, and so on). If he had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a fatespinner, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Spin Fate (Ex)	KEY:Fatespinner ~ Spin Fate	SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.FatespinnerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A mage of many fates understands that "chance" is not as random as many believe it to be, and he can adjust the probability of certain events by applying a force that fatespinners refer to as "spin." Each day, a fatespinner can use a number of points of spin equal to his fatespinner class level. As a free action, a fatespinner can use stored spin to boost the save DC of a spell he casts, adding some or all his spin to the DC, on a point-for-point basis. For instance, a 5th-level wizard/3rd-level fatespinner casting fireball could choose to boost the DC of the spell by 1, 2, or 3 points. Once he uses up his spin for the day, his ability to tinker with probability in this fashion is also exhausted for the day. A fatespinner's spin is replenished whenever the character successfully regains his spells for the day (whether through rest, preparation, or prayer).
Fickle Finger of Fate (Ex)	KEY:Fatespinner ~ Fickle Finger of Fate	SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.FatespinnerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:On reaching 2nd level, a fatespinner gains the ability to affect the luck of others. Once per day as an immediate action (see page 86), he can force any other creature-friend or enemy-to reroll a roll that it has just made. A fatespinner must have line of sight to the creature to be affected. That creature must abide by the result of the reroll, whether it's higher or lower than the original roll.
Spin Destiny (Ex)	KEY:Fatespinner ~ Spin Destiny	SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.FatespinnerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a fatespinner more clearly comprehends the matrix of reality and can use accumulated spin to adjust other random events. The method is identical to increasing a spell's save DC, but the fatespinner can now add spin to any skill check, attack roll, or saving throw that he attempts on a point-for-point basis. However, the spin utilized comes from the same limited reservoir of karma storage that allows him to adjust the DC of his spells. He must apply the bonus before making the roll.
Deny Fate (Ex)	KEY:Fatespinner ~ Deny Fate	SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.FatespinnerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level and higher, a fatespinner has a better chance of beating the odds should he ever be rendered unconscious and dying. Once per day, on the first occasion when a fatespinner must make a check to become stable when dying, the check automatically succeeds. Other such checks called for later in the same 24-hour period are made normally.
Resist Fate (Ex)	KEY:Fatespinner ~ Resist Fate	SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.FatespinnerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A fatespinner of 4th level and above embraces his extraordinary good luck. Once per day, he can reroll one roll that he has just made. He must abide by the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll.
Seal Fate (Su)	KEY:Fatespinner ~ Seal Fate	SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.FatespinnerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 5th-level fatespinner can meddle in success and failure, and even life and death, sealing the fate of a friend or foe. Once per day as a free action, the fatespinner selects a target creature he can see within 30 feet with Hit Dice equal to or less than his. The creature receives either a -10 penalty or a +10 bonus on its next saving throw, as decided by the fatespinner. If the selected target has more Hit Dice than the fatespinner, the ability doesn't work but the use for the day is not wasted. This effect lasts only for 1 round, so if no spell or other effect is brought to bear on the target creature during the round, the creature's fate is no longer sealed.

# Geometer
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Geometer ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.GeometerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Geometers gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Geometer ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.GeometerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At each level, a geometer gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a geometer, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Glyph of Warding	KEY:Geometer ~ Glyph of Warding	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.GeometerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A geometer adds glyph of warding to his spellbook as a 3rd-level arcane spell. He can prepare and cast the spell just like any other spell he knows.
Spellglyph (Su)	KEY:Geometer ~ Spellglyph	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.GeometerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A spellglyph is an arcane diagram that substitutes for a specific spell's verbal and material components (if any). When a geometer casts a prepared spell in conjunction with a spellglyph scribed for that spell, he can cast the spell as if it were affected by the Silent Spell feat. The spellglyph replaces any material components (other than a focus) normally required by the spell. A geometer chooses at the time of casting whether to use a spellglyph. An expended spellglyph disappears, just like any other material component. Spellglyphs are normally scribed on parchment, much like scrolls. Preparing a spellglyph requires 1 hour and the use of rare inks costing 25 gp per spell level. If the spell normally requires an expensive material component (with a value of more than 1 gp), exotic inks and treatments of equal cost must be used in the preparation of the spellglyph.
Book of Geometry (Ex)	KEY:Geometer ~ Book of Geometry	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.GeometerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level and higher, a geometer uses a unique system for recording the details of a spell that drastically reduces the expense of maintaining spellbooks. Every spell he learns from now on requires only a single page in his spellbook. It still takes 24 hours to scribe a spell into a spellbook and materials costing 100 gp per page. A geometer's spellbook is difficult for nongeometers to decipher and use. The Spellcraft DC to decipher or prepare spells from a geometer's spellbook is increased by 5 for nongeometers (see page 178 of the Player's Handbook).
Sigilsight (Ex)	KEY:Geometer ~ Sigilsight	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.GeometerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A geometer of 3rd level or higher can use a Search check to find magic traps based on runes, glyphs, sigils, symbols, and other writings as a rogue can. He gains a bonus equal to his caster level on all Search checks to find traps of this sort. A geometer who merely comes within 10 feet of a magic rune, glyph, sigil, or symbol, or the threshold of danger for such a device, is entitled to make a Search check as if he were actively searching for a magic trap.
Pass Sigil (Su)	KEY:Geometer ~ Pass Sigil	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.GeometerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a geometer can temporarily negate magical wards based on written symbols, sigils, runes, or glyphs. As a standard action, a geometer can attempt to pass such a sigil. He must succeed on a level check (DC 6 + the sigil creator's caster level). If successful, he can suppress the effects of the device for as long as he maintains concentration (which might make it possible for others to pass the sigil safely, too). A geometer must be able to see the device to be passed.
Powerful Spellglyph (Ex)	KEY:Geometer ~ Powerful Spellglyph	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.GeometerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When a 5th-level geometer prepares a spellglyph for a spell, he knows how to strengthen the spell beyond its normal effects. His caster level is treated as 1 higher for any spell he casts with the use of a spellglyph.
Greater Glyph of Warding	KEY:Geometer ~ Greater Glyph of Warding	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.GeometerClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 5th-level geometer adds greater glyph of warding to his spellbook as a 6th-level arcane spell. He can prepare and cast the spell just like any other spell he knows.

# Green Star Adept
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Green Star Adept ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Green Star AdeptClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Green Star adepts gain proficiency with simple weapons. They gain no proficiency with armor or shields.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Green Star Adept ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Green Star AdeptClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At every even-numbered level, a Green Star adept gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a Green Star adept, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Damage Reduction (Ex)	KEY:Green Star Adept ~ Damage Reduction	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Green Star AdeptClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The starmetal infusion reinforces the flesh of a Green Star adept, making him resistant to physical blows. He gains damage reduction 1/adamantine. Each level thereafter, his damage reduction improves by 1, until by 10th level, he has damage reduction 10/adamantine.
Improved Caster Level (Ex)	KEY:Green Star Adept ~ Improved Caster Level	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Green Star AdeptClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A Green Star adept adds his class level to his caster level in another arcane spellcasting class to determine his effective spellcaster level. If the character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a Green Star adept, the player must decide to which class to add each adept level for this purpose. For example, a 5th-level wizard/4th-level Green Star adept's caster level would be 9th, due to this ability, but he would only have access to 4th-level spells (5th-level wizard plus two arcane spellcasting class levels from being a 4th-level Green Star adept).
Starmetal Dependency (Ex)	KEY:Green Star Adept ~ Starmetal Dependency	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Green Star AdeptClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A Green Star adept must consume more starmetal to continue his transformation. When he gains a level in this class beyond 1st, he does not gain any of the class features for that level until he performs a special ritual that requires 24 hours, 1 pound of starmetal, and other arcane reagents and materials costing 1,000 gp. A Green Star adept's base attack bonus, saving throws, skills, and feats or ability score increases are not dependent on this ritual-he fails to gain the special class abilities only until he completes the ritual. See page 141 for a description of starmetal as a new special material.
Starmetal Rigor (Ex)	KEY:Green Star Adept ~ Starmetal Rigor	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Green Star AdeptClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a Green Star adept's process of transformation has already begun. His flesh takes on a faint emerald hue, and it becomes denser and stronger as the starmetal infusion takes hold. A 1st-level adept's Strength score increases by 1, but his Dexterity score drops by 1 (to a minimum of 3). His natural armor bonus also improves by 1. When an adept reaches 4th level, his Strength and his natural armor bonus improve by an additional 1 point. At 7th level, an adept's Strength increases by 2 more, for a total increase of +4, while his Dexterity is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 3). His natural armor bonus improves by another 2 points, for a total bonus of +4. At 10th level, an adept's Strength score increases by 2 more points (total increase of +6) and his Dexterity is reduced by 1 (total reduction of -3, to a minimum of 3). His natural armor bonus improves by another 2 points, for a total bonus of +6.
Natural Attack (Ex)	KEY:Green Star Adept ~ Natural Attack	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Green Star AdeptClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a Green Star adept has flesh so dense that his unarmed strikes deal substantial damage. He gains a slam attack that deals bludgeoning damage equal to a club sized for the character (1d4 for Small adepts, 1d6 for Medium adepts, or 1d8 for Large adepts), plus 1-1/2 times his Strength modifier.
Unnatural Metabolism (Ex)	KEY:Green Star Adept ~ Unnatural Metabolism	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Green Star AdeptClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When an adept reaches 2nd level, his starmetal infusion begins to radically alter his metabolism. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and necromancy effects. At 5th level, a Green Star adept's bonus on saving throws against the attack forms listed above increases to +4. At 8th level, the save bonus increases to +6.
Fortification (Ex)	KEY:Green Star Adept ~ Fortification	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Green Star AdeptClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, a Green Star adept has resistance to attacks that affect other living creatures. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the character, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and the damage is instead rolled normally. When an adept reaches 6th level, this ability improves, increasing the chance of negating a critical hit or sneak attack to 50%. At 9th level, a Green Star adept has a 75% chance to negate a critical hit or sneak attack.
Otherworldly Vision (Ex)	KEY:Green Star Adept ~ Otherworldly Vision	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Green Star AdeptClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level, a Green Star adept gains darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.
Null Metabolism (Ex)	KEY:Green Star Adept ~ Null Metabolism	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Green Star AdeptClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When a Green Star adept reaches 7th level, his transformation approaches completion. He no longer needs to breathe, eat, or sleep. He has immunity to inhaled poisons, drowning, suffocation, and sleep effects (although he still must rest 8 hours in order to regain spells). In addition, an adept of 7th level or higher is no longer subject to fatigue or exhaustion and ignores the effects of these conditions.
Emerald Perfection (Ex)	KEY:Green Star Adept ~ Emerald Perfection	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Green Star AdeptClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, a Green Star adept completes his transformation. He resembles a perfectly sculpted statue of himself, forged from green starmetal. His type changes to construct, which brings about the following alterations to his basic nature: -An adept loses his Constitution score and any hit point adjustment for Constitution. However, he gains bonus hit points based on his size: +10 hit points for Small, +20 hit points for Medium, or +30 hit points for Large. -Unlike other constructs, a Green Star adept has no special immunity to mind-affecting effects. He is essentially a human mind in a magically animated body. -He gains immunity to poison, paralysis, stunning, disease, extra damage from sneak attacks, death effects, and necromancy effects. -He no longer heals damage on his own, and receives no benefit from spells or effects that heal living creatures. However, he can repair himself by means of repair damage spells (see page 120) or his rapid repair ability (see below). -He is no longer subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. -He gains immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects, or is harmless. -He is no longer at risk of death from massive damage, but he is immediately destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points. However, unlike other constructs, a Green Star adept can be returned from the dead by any means that would have worked on him before his final transformation. -He no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. He cannot die of old age and might exist in this form for eons.
Rapid Repair (Ex)	KEY:Green Star Adept ~ Rapid Repair	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Green Star AdeptClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 10th-level Green Star adept repairs 1 point of damage per hour of rest, as long he has at least 1 hit point. Rapid repair does not allow a Green Star adept to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At each level, an Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If she had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Warding (Sp)	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Warding	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil can create a warding. She can choose one veil she knows (see below) to be imbued in the warding. A warding lasts for a certain amount of time as indicated in its description, unless it is dismissed (the same way a spell is dismissed; see page 176 of the Player's Handbook). When she creates a warding, she can choose one of three types.
Personal	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Personal	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:This warding is a sphere whose diameter is equal to an initiate's space (5 feet for Small or Medium creatures, 10 feet for Large, and so on) and encapsulates the initiate. It moves with her, but she cannot force another creature to pass through it (for example, by attempting to grapple an enemy). If she does force a creature to pass through, the warding has no effect on that creature. Any creature striking at her with a melee weapon or natural attack is subject to the veil's effect (although creatures using reach weapons are not). The warding provides concealment to the initiate, but she can see out with no hindrance. It lasts for 1 minute per level or until dismissed.
Area	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Area	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An area warding affects an initiate's space and all adjacent squares (a sphere 15 feet in diameter for a Small or Medium initiate, 20 feet in diameter for a Large initiate, and so on). Any creature who remains adjacent to the initiate gains the benefit of the warding's protection, even if part of its body lies outside the sphere. Moving out of the warding (stepping away from the initiate) is completely safe, but anyone attempting to enter the warding-even someone who was formerly inside it and left-becomes subject to the effects of the chosen veil. The warding moves with the initiate, but she cannot force another creature to pass through it (for example, by moving adjacent to an enemy). If she does force a creature to pass through, the warding has no effect on that creature. This warding provides concealment to all within from creatures outside, but anyone inside the warding can see out with no hindrance. It lasts for 1 minute per level or until dismissed.
Wall	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Wall	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:This warding takes the form of a wall, up to 10 feet long and 5 feet high per initiate class level. For example, a 3rd-level Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil could create a warding wall 30 feet long and 15 feet high. The wall can be made smaller, but it is not otherwise shapeable. The wall must begin within 30 feet of the initiate, but can extend beyond that distance. The wall is immobile once created. An initiate may choose to make crossing through the wall in one direction safe, if she chooses. In any event, she can pass through her own warding wall with no danger. This warding provides concealment to creatures on either side. It lasts for 10 minutes per level or until dismissed. The save DC for an initiate's warding is equal to 18 + her primary spellcasting ability modifier (Intelligence for wizards, Charisma for sorcerers and bards, and so on). The spell level equivalent of a warding depends on which veil is integrated into it.
Veils	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Veils	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When an initiate creates a warding, she can choose and imbue the warding with any one veil she knows how to create. These veils duplicate the layers of a prismatic wall and are described below. An initiate's caster level for these veils is equal to her arcane spellcaster level.
Red Veil	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Red Veil	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The first veil an initiate learns is the red veil. A warding imbued with this veil blocks all nonmagical ranged attacks and missiles. A creature crossing a red veil takes 20 points of fire damage (Reflex half). A cone of cold spell or effect destroys a warding with this veil but is negated in the process. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.
Orange Veil	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Orange Veil	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, an initiate learns the secret of the orange veil. A warding with this veil halts magical ranged attacks, including spells that conjure missiles (such as Melf's acid arrow) or create rays (such as disintegrate or a beholder's eye rays) but not spells that do not require a ranged attack (such as magic missile). A creature crossing an orange veil takes 40 points of acid damage (Reflex half). A gust of wind spell or similar effect destroys the veil but is negated in the process. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.
Yellow Veil	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Yellow Veil	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An initiate of 3rd level or higher can create a yellow veil. This veil prevents gases or clouds from entering the warded area, and it defeats petrification attacks. In addition, a character inside a personal or area warding imbued with a yellow veil has immunity to poison introduced from outside the warding (such as from a creature with an envenomed weapon striking through the barrier). A creature crossing a yellow veil takes 80 points of electricity damage (Reflex half). A disintegrate spell destroys theveil but is negated in the process. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.
Green Veil	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Green Veil	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 4th-level initiate masters the green veil. This veil stops the passage of breath weapons. A creature crossing a green veil must succeed on a Fortitude save or die; on a successful save, the creature takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage. This veil is a poison effect. A passwall spell destroys a green veil. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.
Blue Veil	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Blue Veil	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, an initiate learns the blue veil. This veil blocks all divinations and mind-affecting spells and abilities. Any creature crossing a blue veil must succeed on a Fortitude save or be petrified. A magic missile spell destroys a blue veil but is negated by it. A warding with this is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.
Indigo Veil	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Indigo Veil	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 6th-level initiate can create the mighty indigo veil. This veil prevents the passage of all spells or spell-like abilities. Any creature crossing an indigo veil must succeed on a Will save or become confused, as if by an insanity spell. A daylight spell negates and is negated by an indigo veil. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of a 7th-level spell.
Violet Veil	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Violet Veil	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level, an initiate masters the seventh and final veil: the violet veil. This barrier destroys all objects and effects that cross it, as if they were disintegrated. Living creatures passing a violet veil must succeed on a Will save or be shifted to a random place on a random plane (as the plane shift spell). A violet veil is destroyed by a successful dispel magic spell. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.
Unimpeachable Abjuration (Ex)	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Unimpeachable Abjuration	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An initiate's abjuration spells are particularly difficult to defeat with spells or effects that dispel them. An initiate can add her class level to the DC to dispel any abjuration spell or effect she creates.
Unanswerable Strike (Ex)	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Unanswerable Strike	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Due to her study of magical defenses, an initiate learns how to defeat them more easily. At 2nd level and higher, she gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to counter or dispel abjuration spells. At 6th level, this bonus increases to a +4 bonus.
Reactive Warding (Sp)	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Reactive Warding	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level, an initiate learns to create a warding (see above) in response to an attack. She can raise a warding as an immediate action (see page 86), after an opponent begins an action but before it is completed. For example, if she sees an enemy warrior charging her, she can raise a warding to protect herself. The opponent can choose to continue the charge through the warding or can halt outside it.
Double Warding	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Double Warding	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 6th level and higher, an initiate can raise two veils at once any time she creates a warding. This still counts as only one use of her warding ability. The less powerful effect (progressing from red up through violet) is always considered to be "outside" the more powerful effect, so a double warding consisting of a blue veil and a green veil would subject any creature passing through to the green veil first, followed by the blue veil. To negate the entire warding, the outermost veil must be negated before the inner veil can be negated.
Kaleidoscopic Doom (Sp)	KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Kaleidoscopic Doom	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Initiate of the Sevenfold VeilClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level, an Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil learns the secret of the awesome kaleidoscopic doom. Once per day as a standard action, she designates one creature within 60 feet and turns magical effects currently affecting the creature against it. This effect functions like a targeted greater dispel magic, except that for every spell or effect negated on the target, the effect of one veil (see above) is visited on the victim as if the subject had crossed it. The veils created around the victim proceed through the spectrum from red to violet, with one veil activated per spell negated. Thus, a creature with three spells negated would be subject to the effects of the red, orange, and yellow veils. The subject is still entitled to the normal saving throws allowed by each veil. This ability is the equivalent of a 9thlevel spell.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a mage of the Arcane Order, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Guild Member	KEY:Mage of the Arcane Order ~ Guild Member	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Mage of the Arcane OrderClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A "guild-level" mage of the Arcane Order pays monetary dues and accepts various duties in return for member benefits. The dues are 30 gp per month. Duties include putting in an appearance on campus at least once every six months and accepting any special commissions handed down by senior members. A guildmage who falls into arrears on his dues by more than three months has his membership revoked and loses access to the Spellpool. Reinstating membership is difficult. However, ex-members do not lose any spells or metamagic feats they had gained while in good standing. A member in good standing can board at the Arcane Order campus between adventures, paying only 5 sp per day for common-quality meals and lodging. At his leisure, he can browse the Order's well-respected library, which is stocked with tomes on both mundane and arcane lore (though no spellbooks are kept here). Likewise, he can use the Order's common laboratory facilities when creating magic items (although material costs remain out-of-pocket). Furthermore, he is free to read and post notices to the "job board," a mundane medium whereby fellow members of the Order pass information, advertise their interest in a research topic or adventure, or attempt to sell an interesting oddity, magical or otherwise. Last but not least, members form professional ties with their fellow wizards, possibly leading to lasting friendships or alliances.
Spellpool (Su)	KEY:Mage of the Arcane Order ~ Spellpool	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Mage of the Arcane OrderClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Mages of the Arcane Order can call spells from a common source: the Spellpool. New members receive a special focus (a trinket chosen by the spellcaster, such as a ring, brooch, scarf, or other portable item) at the time of their initiation. The focus allows access to the Spellpool and works only for its owner. If a mage of the Arcane Order loses his focus, he must undergo another initiation. The range of available spells increases at 4th and 7th levels. See the sidebar below for details.
Bonus Metamagic Feat	KEY:Mage of the Arcane Order ~ Bonus Metamagic Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Mage of the Arcane OrderClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level and again at 9th level, a mage of the Arcane Order gains sudden insight from studying the reconstructed texts of ancient magical grimoires. He gains a metamagic feat of his choice as a bonus feat. He must still meet the prerequisites of the feat.
Bonus Language	KEY:Mage of the Arcane Order ~ Bonus Language	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Mage of the Arcane OrderClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level and again at 6th level, a guildmage's access to the Order's superb library and resources allows him to learn a new language.
New Spell	KEY:Mage of the Arcane Order ~ New Spell	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Mage of the Arcane OrderClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When a mage of the Arcane Order reaches 5th level, and again at 8th level, a fellow wizard allows the character to copy a spell from his or her spellbook (chosen by the player, subject to the DM's approval). He does not need to make a Spellcraft check to copy the spell into his own spellbook, although specialist wizards still cannot learn spells from prohibited schools. Spellcasters who do not use spellbooks gain no benefit from this ability.
Regent	KEY:Mage of the Arcane Order ~ Regent	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Mage of the Arcane OrderClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 10th-level mage of the Arcane Order is awarded the status of regent. A regent gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma-based interaction checks when dealing with lower-level members of the Order. The regents set the Arcane Order's rules and policies, meeting each month in the Council of Regents. A regent must attend six council meetings in one year or be removed from the council and lose his regent status (he loses no other benefits of guild membership, nor does he lose his level in the prestige class). Enacting new policies or eradicating old ones requires a three-fifths majority vote to pass. Generally, the council hands out commissions for lowerlevel mages of the Arcane Order to perform on behalf of the guild. An individual regent might also head up a special group of lower-level members to accomplish a specific goal, such as investigating a crime committed using magic, undertaking an archeological dig of an ancient site of wizardry, or some other important task.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a master transmogrifist, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Extended Change (Ex)	KEY:Master Transmogrifist ~ Extended Change	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Master TransmogrifistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A master transmogrifist gains the benefit of the Extend Spell feat on any transmutation spell he casts to change into one of his favored shapes (see below). This benefit does not increase the spell's level or casting time, or require any special preparation. Spells that can benefit from this ability include alter self, polymorph, polymorph any object, and shapechange.
Favored Shape (Su)	KEY:Master Transmogrifist ~ Favored Shape	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Master TransmogrifistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A master transmogrifist chooses three favored shapes at 1st level. A favored shape is a specific kind of creature whose form he can assume by means of the polymorph spell. He cannot choose a creature of his own type (humanoid, most likely) as a favored shape. For example, an 8th-level human sorcerer/1st-level master transmogrifist might choose pegasus, umber hulk, and bronze dragon as his favored shapes, though because of the Hit Dice restriction, he could become only a very young bronze dragon. A master transmogrifist gains a number of advantages with his favored shapes, as noted in the following class feature descriptions. At every odd-numbered level beyond 1st, a master transmogrifist gains one additional favored shape. Thus, he has four at 3rd level, five at 5th level, six at 7th level, and seven at 9th level. Furthermore, once per master transmogrifist level beyond 1st, a character can choose to lose a previously chosen favored shape and select a replacement.
Manifest Senses (Su)	KEY:Master Transmogrifist ~ Manifest Senses	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Master TransmogrifistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level and higher, a master transmogrifist gains the senses of his favored shape when he assumes its form.

Effortless Change (Ex)	KEY:Master Transmogrifist ~ Effortless Change	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Master TransmogrifistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level, a master transmogrifist learns how to change his form through a simple act of will. He can choose to apply the benefits of the Still Spell and Silent Spell feats (even if he doesn't have the feats) to any transmutation spell he casts to change into one of his favored shapes. This benefit does not increase the spell's level or casting time, or require any special preparation. Spells that can benefit from this ability include alter self, polymorph, polymorph any object, and shapechange.
Shapechanger (Ex)	KEY:Master Transmogrifist ~ Shapechanger	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Master TransmogrifistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A master transmogrifist acquires the shapechanger subtype at 5th level. He also gains the ability to remain in an assumed form indefinitely when he casts alter self. This works exactly like the alter self spell except that the duration is permanent. In other words, a master transmogrifist can remain in the form he assumes as long as he wishes, until either he chooses to dismiss it or the alter self effect is dispelled.
Reflexive Change (Ex)	KEY:Master Transmogrifist ~ Reflexive Change	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Master TransmogrifistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level and higher, a master transmogrifist has the ability to change into a favored shape via a transmutation spell in response to an opponent's action once per day. If he has an appropriate spell prepared and chooses to use this ability, he can change form as an immediate action (see page 86) in response to the action of another creature. For example, a master transmogrifist might turn into a dragon turtle to gain a high Armor Class against an impending attack, or change into a red dragon to gain immunity to the fire damage of an enemy's fire storm spell. The spell is expended as if the transmogrifist had cast it normally, and he remains in his new form until either the spell's duration expires or he dismisses it. A transmogrifist gives up his next action to make a reflexive change. If a master transmogrifist is currently under the effect of a shapechange spell he cast on himself, he can use his reflexive change ability as often as he likes (although never more than once per round). Each time he uses it, he loses his next action.
Manifest Qualities (Ex)	KEY:Master Transmogrifist ~ Manifest Qualities	SOURCEPAGE:p.53	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Master TransmogrifistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 8th level and higher, a master transmogrifist has all the extraordinary special qualities of any favored shape he assumes. For example, he could change into a troll to make use of the troll's regeneration ability, or take the form of a green hag to gain spell resistance 18.
Infinite Variety (Su)	KEY:Master Transmogrifist ~ Infinite Variety	SOURCEPAGE:p.53	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Master TransmogrifistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, a master transmogrifist gains the ability to create completely imaginary forms when he casts polymorph, polymorph any object, or shapechange on himself. To create an imaginary form, he chooses one of his favored shapes as a base form. He can then choose a single aspect of a second monster whose form he could assume using the spell he is casting and add it to the first creature. His available options include the following. . Replace the base form's natural armor bonus with that of the second form. . Add the second form's movement modes. . Add one of the second form's natural attack types (with the appropriate reach), if the base form doesn't have that attack type already. . Add an extraordinary special attack of the second form. . Add an extraordinary special quality of the second form. . Replace one of the base form's physical ability scores, if both the base form and the second form are the same size category. For example, if a young red dragon is the base form and a giant octopus is the second, a master transmogrifist could add the octopus's eight tentacle rakes (damage 1d4 + Str bonus) to the dragon's available natural attacks.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a mindbender, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Push the Weak Mind (Sp)	KEY:Mindbender ~ Push the Weak Mind	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.MindbenderClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level and higher, a mindbender can influence the actions of a living creature of Large or smaller size once per day. This ability functions like a suggestion spell, except that the range is 100 feet and the duration is 5 hours plus 1 hour per class level. The mindbender can communicate the suggested course of action telepathically if he chooses, which allows him to use the effect regardless of the target's language. A successful Will save (DC 13 + primary spellcasting ability modifier) negates the effect. (Primary spellcasting ability is Intelligence for wizards, Charisma for sorcerers and warlocks, Wisdom for clerics, and so forth.) A mindbender can use this ability one additional time per day per three class levels gained (two times per day at 5th and three times per day at 8th).
Mindread (Sp)	KEY:Mindbender ~ Mindread	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.MindbenderClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, a mindbender can read the surface thoughts of a living creature within 100 feet. This is a mind-affecting ability that requires a standard action to use. The mindbender must be able to see the target; a successful Will save (DC 12 + primary spellcasting ability modifier) negates the effect. Creatures of animal intelligence (Int 1 or 2) have only simple, instinctual thoughts. Maintaining the effect requires concentration; the maximum duration is 10 minutes. The ability can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. This effect is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. A mindbender can use this ability two times per day at 3rd level and four times per day at 7th level.
Eternal Charm (Sp)	KEY:Mindbender ~ Eternal Charm	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.MindbenderClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level and higher, a mindbender can charm any single Large or smaller living creature within 100 feet (as charm monster) once per day. A successful Will save (DC 14 + primary spellcasting ability modifier) negates the effect. The duration is permanent; however, a mindbender can have only one creature so charmed at any given time. If he attempts to use this power on a creature while he has another so charmed, the first charm is automatically broken (regardless of the success of the second attempt). The effect is also broken if a mindbender or one of his allies injures the target. Dispel magic has no effect on an eternal charm, though break enchantment frees the victim (treat the mindbender's caster level as 5 + his class level for this purpose). At 6th level and higher, a mindbender can have up to two creatures affected by this power at any given time; if he attempts to charm a third, the previous victim under his influence the longest is freed. At 8th level, he can control up to three creatures with this ability, and at 10th level up to four creatures.
Enchantment Spell Power (Ex)	KEY:Mindbender ~ Enchantment Spell Power	SOURCEPAGE:p.56	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.MindbenderClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 6th level and higher, a mindbender casts more powerful enchantment spells: He adds 2 to his caster level when casting any enchantment spell.

Seeker Music	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Seeker Music	SOURCEPAGE:p.57	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A seeker of the song can use music or poetics to produce magical effects. Seeker music follows the same rules as bardic music (see page 29 of the Player's Handbook). Each use of seeker music costs one daily use of bardic music to activate. Seeker of the song levels stack with bard levels for purposes of determining how many daily uses of bardic music and seeker music the character has. Some seeker music effects include a secondary effect, called a refrain. In any round when a seeker concentrates on a seeker music effect and expends another use of bardic music, she can activate the refrain associated with that seeker music effect. Using a refrain is a swift action (see page 86) that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The original effects of the song do not end; the seeker can maintain the song and activate the refrain simultaneously.

The cone deals 6d6 points of fire damage to creatures in its area. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + the seeker's ranks in the Perform skill) halves the damage.
Song of Unmaking (Su)	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Song of Unmaking	SOURCEPAGE:p.57	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level and higher, a seeker with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can turn a fragment of the primal music's power against constructs. She can expend a use of bardic music and make a Perform check to deal 1d8 points of damage per seeker level to all constructs within a 30-foot burst of the seeker (no save).
Dirge of Frozen Loss (Su)	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Dirge of Frozen Loss	SOURCEPAGE:p.57	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A seeker of the song of 3rd level or higher with 16 or more ranks in a Perform skill can gather the power of the primal music to gain control over cold energy through this music. While a seeker sings this song, she and all of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain resistance to cold 15. An ally benefits from this effect for as long as it can hear the seeker sing.
Dirge of Frozen Loss, Refrain	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Dirge of Frozen Loss (Refrain)	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When she uses the refrain with her dirge of frozen loss, a seeker shoots a 60-foot line of cold energy from her fingertips. The line deals 10d6 points of cold damage to any creature it hits and causes any creature damaged by it to become fatigued. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + the seeker's ranks in the Perform skill) halves the damage and negates the fatigue.
Song of Life (Su)	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Song of Life	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A seeker of the song of 4th level or higher with 17 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use fragments of the primal music to protect and heal her allies. While a seeker sings this song, she and all of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain immunity to poison and disease. An ally benefits from this effect for as long as it can hear the seeker sing.
Song of Life, Refrain	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Song of Life (Refrain)	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When she uses the refrain with her dirge of frozen loss, a seeker can make a Perform check to heal a living creature of an amount of hit point damage equal to the check result (up to the creature's full normal hit point total). She must touch the affected ally to use this ability. The touch is a standard action, although activating the refrain is still a swift action. The refrain has no effect on undead or nonliving creatures.
Anthem of Thunder and Pain (Su)	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Anthem of Thunder and Pain	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A seeker of the song of 5th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can gather the power of the primal music and gain some control over electrical energy through this music. While a seeker sings this song, she and all of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain resistance to electricity 15. An ally benefits from this effect for as long as it can hear the seeker sing.
Anthem of Thunder and Pain, Refrain	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Anthem of Thunder and Pain (Refrain)	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When she uses the refrain with her anthem of thunder and pain, a seeker shoots a ray of electricity from her fingertips. The ray has a range of 20 feet and requires a ranged touch attack to hit. The ray deals 10d6 points of electricity damage to a creature it hits. The seeker can then cause the electricity to arc to additional foes, all of whom must be within 20 feet of the first creature struck. Each secondary ray requires another ranged touch attack to hit and deals half as much damage as the initial ray. A seeker can create one secondary ray for every three seeker class levels (one when the song becomes available at 5th level, two at 6th level, and three at 9th level). No creature can be affected by more than one arc in a single round.
Hymn of Spelldeath (Su)	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Hymn of Spelldeath	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A seeker of the song of 6th level or higher with 19 or more ranks in a Perform skill can turn the power of the primal music against magic effects. Any creature that can hear the seeker perform must make a Concentration check opposed by the seeker's Perform check in order to cast a spell. If the Concentration check fails, the spell is lost and has no effect. If the Concentration check succeeds, the spell is cast as normal. A hymn of spelldeath is a mind-affecting ability.
Hymn of Spelldeath, Refrain	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Hymn of Spelldeath (Refrain)	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When she uses the refrain with her hymn of spelldeath, a seeker can attempt to dispel magic. This ability works just like the area version of dispel magic, except the effect is centered on the seeker. At her option, a seeker can exclude herself and her allies from this effect, but the effect must still be centered on her. The seeker makes a level check just as if she were a spellcaster using the dispel magic spell, using the total of her bard levels and seeker of the song levels as her modifier for the check.
Ballad of Agony Reborn (Su)	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Ballad of Agony Reborn	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A seeker of the song of 7th level or higher with 20 or more ranks in a Perform skill can gather the power of the primal music to gain control over acid energy through this music. While a seeker sings this song, she and all of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain resistance to acid 15. An ally benefits from this effect for as long as it can hear the seeker sing.
Ballad of Agony Reborn, Refrain	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Ballad of Agony Reborn (Refrain)	SOURCEPAGE:p.58	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When she uses the refrain with her ballad of agony reborn, a seeker shoots a ray of acid from her fingertips. The ray has a range of 60 feet and requires a ranged touch attack to hit. The ray deals 10d6 points of acid damage to a creature it hits, and another 10d6 points of acid damage 1 round later.
Aria of Everywhere (Sp)	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Aria of Everywhere	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A seeker of the song of 8th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can pull the power of the primal music into herself and move short distances instantaneously. She can expend a use of bardic music or seeker music to instantly transport herself to any other spot within 25 feet + 5 feet/level. This ability otherwise functions as the dimension door spell, except that the seeker can't bring along additional creatures with this ability.
Dirge of Songdeath (Su)	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Dirge of Songdeath	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A seeker of the song of 9th level or higher with 22 or more ranks in a Perform skill can gather the power of the primal music to gain control over sonic energy through this music. While a seeker sings this song, she and all of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain resistance to sonic 15. An ally benefits from this effect for as long as it can hear the seeker sing. In addition, as long as the seeker is singing a dirge of songdeath, other creatures within 30 feet cannot easily use bardic music, seeker music, or similar abilities. To use such an ability, a creature within the area must make a Perform check opposed by the seeker's Perform check. If the check is successful, the creature can use the ability as desired. If the check fails, the ability has no effect, but a daily use of the music ability must be expended normally.
Dirge of Songdeath, Refrain	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Dirge of Songdeath (Refrain)	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When she uses the refrain with her hymn of spelldeath, a seeker shoots a ray of sonic energy from her fingertips. The ray has a range of 60 feet and requires a ranged touch attack to hit. The ray deals 15d6 points of sonic damage to a creature it hits.
Note of Solitude (Su)	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Note of Solitude	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Upon reaching 10th level, a seeker of the song with 23 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use the power of the primal music to temporarily sever some creatures' tie with other planes. Extraplanar creatures within 60 feet of a seeker who activates this ability must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + the seeker's ranks in the Perform skill). Creatures affected by this ability get a bonus on this saving throw equal to their Hit Dice. Any creature that fails this saving throw is instantly sent to its home plane. Unlike other musical abilities and affects, a note of solitude has a duration of instantaneous and cannot be maintained, though the seeker can activate it again on subsequent rounds by spending additional uses of bardic music or seeker music.
Combine Songs (Ex)	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Combine Songs	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A seeker of the song of 2nd level or higher can combine two types of bardic music or seeker music to provide the benefits of both. The seeker chooses two music abilities and activates both using the same standard action. If either or both require concentration, the seeker can maintain concentration on both by using one standard action each round to concentrate. The normal stacking rules for bonus types apply to music abilities combined with this ability.
Subvocalize (Ex)	KEY:Seeker of the Song ~ Subvocalize	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Seeker of the SongClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level and higher, a seeker of the song can begin a new bardic music or seeker music song as a swift action (see page 86). A seeker can use this ability only if he already has one (and only one) bardic music or seeker music ability already active. A seeker can use this ability in conjunction with the combine songs ability to start a second song and then maintain both as a standard action each round (as per the combine songs ability).

# Sublime Chord
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Sublime Chord ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Sublime ChordClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Sublime chords gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor. As with bard spells, the somatic components for a sublime chord's spells do not incur an arcane spell failure chance as normal for arcane spells if the sublime chord is wearing light armor.
Spells per Day	KEY:Sublime Chord ~ Spells per Day	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Sublime ChordClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A sublime chord has the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells, all of 4th level or higher. To cast a sublime chord spell, a character must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so if she has a Charisma of 13 or lower, she cannot cast any sublime chord spells. Bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the sublime chord's Cha modifier. A sublime chord can choose spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list or the bard spell list; if a spell appears on both lists at different levels, she uses the bard version of the spell. A sublime chord's caster level for both her sublime chord spells and the spells she gains from other arcane spellcasting classes is determined by adding her sublime chord level to her level in another arcane spellcasting class. If she had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a sublime chord, she must choose to which class to add her sublime chord levels for the purpose of determining her sublime chord spellcaster level. A sublime chord prepares and casts spells just as a sorcerer does, including the ability to replace a known sublime chord spell with a new spell at every even-numbered class level beginning at 4th.
Bardic Knowledge	KEY:Sublime Chord ~ Bardic Knowledge	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Sublime ChordClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A sublime chord continues to collect the odd bits of lore and knowledge that bards acquire. She can add her sublime chord class level to her bardic knowledge checks, so her bardic knowledge checks have a bonus equal to her bard level + her sublime chord level + her Int modifier.
Bardic Music	KEY:Sublime Chord ~ Bardic Music	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Sublime ChordClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A sublime chord expands her repertoire of bardic music to encompass new songs or poetics of strange and wondrous power. These effects function just as the bardic music effects described in the Player's Handbook. Each use of a sublime chord song expends one daily use of the character's bardic music ability. A sublime chord adds one-half her class level (rounded down) to her bard level to determine her number of daily uses of bardic music.
Song of Arcane Power (Su)	KEY:Sublime Chord ~ Song of Arcane Power	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Sublime ChordClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A sublime chord of 2nd level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill learns how to use her bardic music to assist her spellcasting. As a move action, she can prepare to cast a spell by giving voice to the song of power. The next spell she casts gains a bonus to its caster level based on the result of the sublime chord's Perform check: Perform Check Result Caster Level Increase 9 or lower +0 10 to 19 +1 20 to 29 +2 30 or higher +4 The spell to be enhanced by the song of arcane power must be cast by the end of the sublime chord's next turn, or else the song fades with no effect (other than consuming a bardic music use).
Song of Timelessness (Su)	KEY:Sublime Chord ~ Song of Timelessness	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Sublime ChordClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A sublime chord of 6th level or higher with 16 or more ranks in a Perform skill knows the song of timelessness. As a standard action, she can envelop a single creature within 60 feet in a field of timelessness, provided she has line of effect to the target (see page 176 of the Player's Handbook). The subject is entitled to a Will save (DC 10 + sublime chord level + Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If the subject fails its save, it is frozen in a shimmering aura of timelessness and can take no actions. However, no force can affect it-weapons cannot reach it, spells that target it automatically fail, and if the ground it is standing on is somehow taken away, it would not even begin to fall. A sublime chord can keep her target frozen in time for as long as she maintains the power by continuing to perform, up to a maximum of 1 minute per level. When she stops performing, the subject immediately returns to normal. As far as the creature is concerned, no time seems to have passed.
Song of Cosmic Fire (Su)	KEY:Sublime Chord ~ Song of Cosmic Fire	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Sublime ChordClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 10th-level sublime chord with 20 or more ranks in a Perform skill learns the song of cosmic fire. Using this ability costs a sublime chord two of her daily uses of bardic music. The song of cosmic fire creates a 20-foot-radius spread of fire anywhere within 100 feet of the sublime chord (provided she has line of effect to the fire's point of origin). Creatures in the area take damage equal to the sublime chord's Perform check result. All affected creatures are entitled to a Reflex save (DC 10 + sublime chord level + Cha modifier) for half damage.

# Suel Arcanamach
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Suel Arcanamach ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Suel ArcanamachClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Suel arcanamachs gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor. Armor of any type interferes with an arcanamach's movements, which can cause spells with somatic components to fail (but see Ignore Spell Failure Chance, below).
Spells per Day	KEY:Suel Arcanamach ~ Spells per Day	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Suel ArcanamachClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A Suel arcanamach has the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. To cast a Suel arcanamach spell, he must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so if he has a Charisma of 10 or lower, he cannot cast these spells. Bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + his Cha modifier. When he gets 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance, 1st-level spells for 1st level), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. He has access to any spell of the abjuration, divination, illusion, and transmutation schools on the sorcerer/wizard spell list. He casts spells just as a sorcerer does, including the ability to replace a known Suel arcanamach spell with a new spell at every even-numbered class level beginning at 4th.
Ignore Spell Failure Chance (Ex)	KEY:Suel Arcanamach ~ Ignore Spell Failure Chance	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Suel ArcanamachClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A Suel arcanamach's practice at merging spellcasting and swordplay results in a reduction in the arcane spell failure chance associated with using armor or shields. This reduction starts at 5% at 1st level and increases by 5% every three levels thereafter. The arcanamach subtracts the given percentage value from his total spell failure chance, if any. For example, a 1st-level arcanamach wearing a mithral shirt has a spell failure chance of 5%, not 10%. This ability only functions when the character casts a Suel arcanamach spell.
Tenacious Spells (Ex)	KEY:Suel Arcanamach ~ Tenacious Spells	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Suel ArcanamachClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An arcanamach's Suel arcanamach spells are particularly difficult to dispel; add 6 to the DC required to dispel the character's arcanamach spells.
Dispelling Strike (Su)	KEY:Suel Arcanamach ~ Dispelling Strike	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Suel ArcanamachClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Once per day, a Suel arcanamach of 2nd level or higher can attempt a dispelling strike with one normal melee attack. If he hits, he deals normal damage, and the victim is subject to a targeted greater dispel magic. The arcanamach's dispel check is 1d20 + class level + 6. If a Suel arcanamach makes a dispelling strike against a creature with no spells or effects to dispel, the dispelling strike has no effect, but the ability is used up for that day. At 6th level, an arcanamach can use this power two times per day, and at 10th level he can use it three times per day.
Extended Spellstrength (Ex)	KEY:Suel Arcanamach ~ Extended Spellstrength	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Suel ArcanamachClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a Suel arcanamach knows how to extend the duration of spells that he casts on himself. The duration of any of his Suel arcanamach spells with which he targets himself is doubled, as if affected by the Extend Spell feat (but without any adjustment to the spell's effective level or casting time). For instance, a bull's strength spell cast by a 3rd-level Suel arcanamach on himself has a duration of 6 minutes rather than 3 minutes. Spells that target multiple targets are affected by this power, but only the arcanamach gains the extended duration. For example, a 5th-level arcanamach who casts haste would be hasted for 10 rounds, while his allies would gain the effect only for the normal 5-round duration. Spells that do not have a Target entry are unaffected by this power even if the arcanamach is the only one affected.

# Wayfarer Guide
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Wayfarer Guide ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wayfarer GuideClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Wayfarer guides gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Wayfarer Guide ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wayfarer GuideClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st and 3rd level, a wayfarer guide gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, a bonus feat, and so on). If she had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a wayfarer guide, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Enhanced Capacity (Ex)	KEY:Wayfarer Guide ~ Enhanced Capacity	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wayfarer GuideClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A wayfarer guide can transport material more efficiently. When casting any spell with the teleportation descriptor that allows other willing creatures to be brought along, a wayfarer guide can bring along one additional Medium touched willing creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) per class level, subject to the same restrictions given in the teleport spell description. For example, a 9th-level wizard/ 2nd-level wayfarer guide can bring up to five other Medium or smaller creatures with her (instead of the normal limit of three creatures for an 11th-level caster).
Improved Range (Ex)	KEY:Wayfarer Guide ~ Improved Range	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wayfarer GuideClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A wayfarer guide can travel greater distances when teleporting. When the character casts any spell with the teleportation descriptor, the maximum distance covered by the spell increases by 50%. For example, a 9th-level wizard/ 1st-level wayfarer guide can teleport up to 1,500 miles with a single teleport spell (instead of the normal limit of 1,000 miles for a 10th-level caster).
Extra Teleportation	KEY:Wayfarer Guide ~ Extra Teleportation	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wayfarer GuideClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a wayfarer guide gains an extra 5th-level spell slot, which can be used only for a teleport spell.
Enhanced Accuracy (Ex)	KEY:Wayfarer Guide ~ Enhanced Accuracy	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wayfarer GuideClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, a wayfarer guide becomes more skilled at arriving on target. When casting any spell with the teleportation descriptor that includes a random chance for determining the actual destination (such as teleport), a wayfarer guide can roll twice and choose the result she wants.

# Wild Mage
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Wild Mage ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wild MageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Wild mages gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Wild Mage ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wild MageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At each level, a wild mage gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If she had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a wild mage, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Wild Magic	KEY:Wild Mage ~ Wild Magic	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wild MageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A wild mage casts spells differently from any other arcane spellcaster. She reduces her caster level by 3 for all spells she casts from now on. However, every time she casts a spell, her use of wild magic adds 1d6 to her adjusted caster level. For example, an 8th-level sorcerer/1st-level wild mage has a base caster level of 6th, not 9th, but her actual caster level varies from 7th to 12th for every spell she casts. Caster level affects all level-based variables of a spell, including spell penetration checks.
Random Deflector (Su)	KEY:Wild Mage ~ Random Deflector	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wild MageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level and higher, a wild mage has the ability to protect herself from certain attacks with this ability. Using this ability is an immediate action (see page 86), which means that a wild mage activates it when it is not her turn. When activated, the random deflector lasts until the beginning of the wild mage's next turn. The random deflector redirects ranged attacks, ranged touch attacks, and individually targeted spells (spells designating the wild mage as the sole target, but not area spells striking an area in which she happens to be the sole target) so that they instead attack or affect a random target within 20 feet of the wild mage. A wild mage includes herself and her allies among the possible new targets. Any creature targeted by a deflected attack is attacked or affected normally, so an attack roll is made normally against the new target's AC, the new target receives a saving throw if a spell or effect allows one, and so on. A wild mage can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, two times per day at 5th level, and three times per day at 8th level.
Student of Chaos (Ex)	KEY:Wild Mage ~ Student of Chaos	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wild MageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Whenever a wild mage of 3rd level or higher uses a magic item that offers a randomly determined effect (such as a bag of tricks or rod of wonder), she can roll twice and choose between the two results. If a random roll is made only once to determine the nature or contents of a device (for example, a robe of useful items or an iron flask), a wild mage gains no special advantage.
Chaotic Mind (Su)	KEY:Wild Mage ~ Chaotic Mind	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wild MageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When a wild mage reaches 6th level, the power of chaos infuses her mind. She gains immunity to confusion and insanity spells and effects, and she is shielded by a continuous nondetection effect (as the spell).
Reckless Dweomer (Su)	KEY:Wild Mage ~ Reckless Dweomer	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wild MageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 9th level and higher, a wild mage knows how to spontaneously convert her own spell energy into random, unpredictable results. As a standard action, she can eliminate a prepared spell or spell slot of at least 1st level to create an effect similar to that of activating a rod of wonder. The character's student of chaos ability (see above) applies when she uses her reckless dweomer ability. See page 237 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on the rod of wonder.
Wildstrike (Sp)	KEY:Wild Mage ~ Wildstrike	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Wild MageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, a wild mage gains the ability to make a wildstrike once per day. A wildstrike affects a single creature within 60 feet, surrounding the creature in an aura of shimmering rainbow colors for 2d6 rounds. Spell resistance applies, but the target receives no saving throw. While a wildstrike is in effect, there is a 50% chance each time the affected creature casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability that its intended action fails. Instead, the creature rolls as if it had activated a rod of wonder (see page 237 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
