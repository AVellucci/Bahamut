# Bloodscaled Fury
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:A bloodscaled fury gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.
Fearsome Presence			KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Fearsome Presence						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:A bloodscaled fury is a terror to behold, and the seething fury that churns in its heart inspires terror in all who lay eyes on it. The dragon’s frightful presence becomes more powerful: The saving throw DC to resist the ability is increased by the dragon’s class level. Creatures with Hit Dice equal to or less than 1/2 the dragon’s class level + 4 are panicked if they fail their saving throws, while creatures with more Hit Dice are shaken. Both fear effects last for 6d6 rounds (rather than the usual 4d6).
Draconic Fury			KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Draconic Fury						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:At 2nd level, a bloodscaled fury’s rage becomes more fearsome. While raging, its Strength and Constitution scores increase by an additional 2 points and it gains an additional +1 morale bonus on its Will saves. Thus, an 11th-level barbarian/2nd-level bloodscaled fury gains +8 to its Strength and Constitution scores and +4 on its Will saves. (Its Armor Class penalty remains at –2.) At 6th level, and again at 10th, these bonuses increase by a similar amount. An 11th-level barbarian/10th-level bloodscaled fury gains +12 to its Strength and Constitution scores and +6 on its Will saves.
Scales of Blood			KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Scales of Blood						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a bloodscaled fury earns its name. When it enters a rage, small quantities of blood ooze out around its scales, lining their edges and adding to the dragon’s fearsome appearance. More important, the blood supernaturally wards the dragon from spells and weapon damage. For the duration of the dragon’s rage, its spell resistance increases by its class level, and its damage reduction improves as well. The number before the slash in the dragon’s damage reduction increases by 5 at 3rd level. In addition, at 7th level a bloodscaled fury’s damage reduction can be overcome only by magic cold iron weapons, and at 11th level only by epic cold iron weapons. For example, an old white dragon with damage reduction 10/magic who reaches 3rd level as a bloodscaled fury gains damage reduction 15/magic while raging. At 7th level, it gains damage reduction 15/magic and cold iron while raging, and at 11th level it gains damage reduction 15/epic and cold iron while raging.
Rend					KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Rend								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:At 4th level, a bloodscaled fury gains Rend (see page 73) as a bonus feat, even if it doesn’t have the prerequisites.

Incite Rage				KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Incite Rage							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:At 8th level, a bloodscaled fury gains the ability to incite rage in its allies whenever it enters a rage. The dragon can affect all willing allies within 60 feet, granting them a +4 morale bonus to Strength, a +4 morale bonus to Constitution, a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, and a –2 penalty to Armor Class for as long as the dragon remains raging. This ability is otherwise identical to normal barbarian rage, including the fatigue at the end of the rage.
Tireless Fury			KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Tireless Fury						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:At 9th level, a bloodscaled fury no longer becomes fatigued at the end of its rage.
Blinding Speed			KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Blinding Speed						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:A 12th-level bloodscaled fury can act as if under the effects of a haste spell for a total of 12 rounds each day. The duration of the effect need not be consecutive rounds. Activating this power is a free action.

Fiendbond				KEY:Disciple of Ashardalon ~ Fiendbond							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Disciple of Ashardalon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.88	DESC:As part of its initiation, a disciple of Ashardalon binds a demonic spirit to its own heart, emulating the manner in which Ashardalon himself took a balor as his heart. The dragon’s alignment changes to chaotic evil if it was not already of that alignment. The dragon gains bonus sorcerer spells as if its Charisma score were 2 points higher than actual.
Resistance				KEY:Disciple of Ashardalon ~ Resistance							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Disciple of Ashardalon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.88	DESC:A disciple of Ashardalon gains resistance to acid, cold, electricity, and fire. This resistance is 5 at 1st level, and increases by 5 at 4th level and every four levels thereafter (10 at 4th level, 15 at 8th level, and 20 at 12th level).
Spell-Like Abilities		KEY:Disciple of Ashardalon ~ Spell-Like Abilities					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disciple of Ashardalon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.88	DESC:A disciple of Ashardalon gains spell-like abilities as it increases in level. Its caster level is equal to its class level, and its saving throw DCs are 10 + its Cha modifier + spell level. Once an ability is gained, the disciple can use it a certain number of times per day, as follows: 3/day—darkness, poison, unholy aura; 1/day—blasphemy, contagion, desecrate, destruction, horrid wilting, unhallow, unholy aura, unholy blight.
Skill Point Increase		KEY:Disciple of Ashardalon ~ Skill Point Increase					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disciple of Ashardalon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.89	DESC:At 2nd level, and again at 10th level, a disciple of Ashardalon gains a pool of bonus skill points equal to the number of dragon Hit Dice it possesses. This pool represents a gradual transition from being a creature of the dragon type (with 6 skill points per HD) to being an outsider (with 8 skill points per HD). These bonus skill points are in addition to the skill points gained at every level, and are not modified by the dragon’s Intelligence score.
Ability Increase			KEY:Disciple of Ashardalon ~ Ability Increase						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disciple of Ashardalon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.89	DESC:Every three levels, a disciple of Ashardalon’s ability scores increase automatically. At 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level, its Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence all increase by 1 point. At 6th and 12th level, its Constitution and Charisma also increase by 1 point.

The dragon now has the half-fiend template and becomes an outsider rather than a dragon.

# Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.89	DESC:A dispassionate watcher gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.
Divine Conversion			KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Divine Conversion						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.89	DESC:At 1st level, a dispassionate watcher loses any effective sorcerer level it had previously gained by virtue of its age and draconic variety. Its effective divine spellcasting level increases by the number of sorcerer levels it sacrificed. These effective levels apply only to the dragon’s spellcasting, not to other class abilities (such as turning undead). For example, a very old amethyst dragon/1st-level cleric adopts the dispassionate watcher of Chronepsis prestige class. Its sorcerer caster level of 11th converts into eleven effective cleric levels, giving the dragon the spellcasting ability of a 12th-level cleric.
Calming Aura			KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Calming Aura						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:At 1st level, a dispassionate watcher loses its frightful presence ability (if it had one), gaining instead an infectious aura of calm detachment. This aura has the same radius and Will save DC as the dragon’s frightful presence ability, if it had one. If it did not possess frightful presence, the radius is equal to 5 feet per 2 HD the dragon possesses (counting only its base dragon Hit Dice, not any class levels). The Will saving throw to resist the effect has a DC of 10 + 1/2 dragon’s base HD + its Cha modifier. The effect of the aura is the same as that of a calm emotions spell, but it lasts as long as the dispassionate watcher does not attack.
Draconic Knowledge		KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Draconic Knowledge					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:A dispassionate watcher gains Draconic Knowledge (see page 69) as a bonus feat. It uses its dispassionate watcher level as an additional modifier on its draconic knowledge checks.
Spellcasting			KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Spellcasting						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:From 2nd level on, when a new dispassionate watcher level is gained, the dragon gains new spells per day as if it had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class it belonged to before it added the prestige class. It does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (an improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, wild shape, and so on). This essentially means that the dragon adds the level of dispassionate watcher to the level of whatever divine spellcasting class the dragon has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If the dragon had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a dispassionate watcher, the dragon must decide to which class it adds each level of dispassionate watcher for the purpose of determining spells per day. A very old amethyst dragon/1st-level cleric/2nd-level dispassionate watcher has the spellcasting ability of a 13th level cleric: 11 from divine conversion of its sorcerer spellcasting levels, 1 from its single cleric level, and 1 from its two levels in the prestige class. If a dragon advances an age category after taking levels in this class, the added levels of spellcasting ability are added to its effective divine spellcasting level. If the very old amethyst dragon in the example above lives to be ancient, its spellcasting level would increase by 2, so it would cast spells as a 15th-level cleric.
Comprehend Languages		KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Comprehend Languages					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:At 2nd level, a dispassionate watcher gains the ability to use comprehend languages at will.
Stunning Rebuke			KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Stunning Rebuke						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:A 4th-level dispassionate watcher can deliver a thunderous rebuke that stuns one creature of its choice within 100 feet. If the target creature fails a Will saving throw (DC 10 + dispassionate watcher’s class level + 1/2 its Cha modifier), it is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. This is a sonic effect, but is not language-dependent.
Tongues				KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Tongues							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:A 5th-level dispassionate watcher can use tongues at will.
Discern Lies			KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Discern Lies						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:At 6th level, a dispassionate watcher knows when anyone (other than a deity) is deliberately lying. This ability is like the discern lies spell, except that it works continuously and applies to any creature the dragon can perceive.
Clearsight				KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Clearsight							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:A 9th-level dispassionate watcher can see illusions, transmuted creatures and objects, and disguised creatures and objects for what they really are, provided they are within 30 feet of the dragon. This ability is similar to the true seeing spell, except that it also foils mundane disguises.
Vision				KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Vision							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:At 10th level, a dispassionate watcher gains the ability to use vision three times per day. Using this ability is only a standard action for the dragon.
Analyze Dweomer			KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Analyze Dweomer						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:A 12th-level dispassionate watcher can use analyze dweomer at will.

# Dragon Ascendant
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.91	DESC:A dragon ascendant gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.
Awesome Aura			KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Awesome Aura						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.91	DESC:A dragon ascendant loses its innate frightful presence, replacing it with a special fear aura. This aura surrounds the dragon at any radius it chooses up to the extent of its frightful presence (30 feet × the dragon’s age category), and is always active unless the dragon chooses to deactivate it. The dragon can choose to exclude its own allies from the effect of its aura. Creatures within the aura must make a Will save (DC equal to the dragon’s frightful presence DC plus 1/2 its dragon ascendant levels). Creatures that fail their saving throws are shaken, while those that succeed are immune to the effect of that dragon’s aura for 24 hours. If the dragon attacks or charges, shaken creatures must attempt a second Will save (same DC) or become frightened. When a dragon ascendant reaches 5th level, it can choose to modify its aura to inspire resolve in its allies and dread in its enemies. All allies of the dragon within the radius of its aura receive a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and checks. The dragon’s foes must succeed on a Will saving throw or take a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks. When a dragon ascendant reaches 10th level, it gains a third option for its aura. The dragon can cause affected creatures to become dazed, simply staring at the dragon in fascinated awe, if they fail their Will saves. As with the fear aspect of the aura, the dragon can choose to exclude its allies from the effects of the aura. All uses of a dragon’s awesome aura are mind-affecting effects.
Hit Point Increase		KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Hit Point Increase					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a dragon ascendant gains 1 hit point per Hit Die it possesses, including all its dragon Hit Dice and those gained from class levels. This benefit can never increase a dragon’s hit points above the maximum for its Hit Dice and Constitution bonus. At 12th level, a dragon ascendant’s hit points are equal to the maximum for its Hit Dice and Constitution bonus.
Transmutation Immunity		KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Transmutation Immunity					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:At 3rd level, a dragon ascendant gains immunity to polymorphing, petrification, and any other attack that would alter its form. Any shape-altering powers or spells the dragon has work normally on itself.
Increased Damage Reduction	KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Increased Damage Reduction				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:At 4th level, a dragon ascendant’s damage reduction can be overcome only by epic weapons. At 8th level, the amount of the dragon’s damage reduction (the number before the slash) is increased by 5. For example, an ancient black dragon/8th-level dragon ascendant has damage reduction 20/epic.
Lifewarding				KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Lifewarding							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:At 6th level, a dragon ascendant is no longer vulnerable to attacks that cause energy drain, ability drain, or ability damage.

Iron Mind				KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Iron Mind							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:At 9th level, a dragon ascendant becomes immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).
Resistance to Fire		KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Resistance to Fire					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:At 11th level, a dragon ascendant gains resistance to fire 20, if it does not already possess immunity to fire.
Spell Resistance			KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Spell Resistance						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:At 11th level, a dragon ascendant’s spell resistance increases to 33.
Immortality				KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Immortality							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:A 12th-level dragon ascendant is actually a quasi-deity, and can no longer die from natural causes. It does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. It can still be slain in physical or magical combat, and it is still subject to death from massive damage.
Code of Conduct			KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Code of Conduct						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:A dragon ascendant must be absolutely true to the principles of its alignment, whatever they may be. A dragon ascendant loses its awesome aura if it ever willingly commits an act opposed to its alignment (and it does not regain its frightful presence), and it cannot gain more levels as a dragon ascendant. The dragon can regain its awesome aura and once more advance in the dragon ascendant prestige class if it atones for its violations (see the atonement spell in the Player’s Handbook), as appropriate.

# Elemental Master
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Elemental Master ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elemental Master Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:An elemental master gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.
Element Mastery			KEY:Elemental Master ~ Element Mastery						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Elemental Master Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:At 1st level, an elemental master gains an additional attunement to the element type that corresponds to its subtype. Dragons with the air or electricity subtype (including emerald, green, crystal, fang, and song dragons) gain air mastery: Any airborne creature takes a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls made against the dragon. Dragons with the earth subtype (including blue, copper, amethyst, brown, deep, and sapphire dragons) gain earth mastery: The dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. Dragons with the fire subtype (including red, gold, and brass dragons, as well as hellfire wyrms) gain fire mastery: The dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching fire or using weapons with the flaming or flaming burst special abilities.

Dragons with the cold subtype (silver and white dragons) gain cold mastery: The dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching ice or using weapons with the frost or icy burst special abilities.
Elemental Command			KEY:Elemental Master ~ Elemental Command						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Elemental Master Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:An elemental master can turn or destroy creatures of the elemental subtype opposed to its own subtype, just as a good cleric turns undead. It can rebuke or command creatures of its own elemental subtype, as an evil cleric rebukes undead. The dragon can use these abilities a total number of times per day equal to 3 + its Charisma modifier. Air and earth are opposed elemental subtypes; fire and water are opposed. Dragons with the cold subtype can rebuke cold creatures and turn fire creatures.
Energy Attunement			KEY:Elemental Master ~ Energy Attunement						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Elemental Master Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:An elemental master is attuned to the energy type that powers its breath weapon. Dragons with more than one breath weapon gain attunement to the one that deals energy damage, usually acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic energy. A dragon with multiple energy breath weapons can choose a single energy type it is attuned to. This ability grants the dragon no special powers, but determines the form of powers it gains later, including energy substitution, energy focus, energy burst, and energy storm.
Energy Substitution		KEY:Elemental Master ~ Energy Substitution					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Elemental Master Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:At 2nd level, an elemental master gains the ability to modify its spells that have an energy descriptor so that they use the dragon’s attuned energy instead. The substituted spell works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealt.
Summon Elemental			KEY:Elemental Master ~ Summon Elemental						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Elemental Master Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:Once per day, starting at 2nd level, an elemental master can use its breath weapon to summon a Medium elemental corresponding to its elemental subtype. The dragon breathes as normal, but in the wake of its breath the elemental appears, attacking in the next round. If it chooses, the dragon can instead summon an adult arrowhawk (air or cold), average salamander (fire), adult tojanida (water), or average xorn (earth). This ability works like the summon nature’s ally V spell, with the dragon’s class level as its caster level. A dragon with the cold subtype can summon a Medium water elemental or an adult tojanida. At 5th level, an elemental master can summon one Large elemental or two Medium elementals. This ability works like the summon nature’s ally VI spell. At 8th level, an elemental master can summon one Huge elemental, two Large elementals, or four Medium elementals. Instead, the dragon can summon one elder arrowhawk, noble salamander, elder tojanida, or elder xorn, or four Medium creatures of the appropriate kind. This ability works like the summon nature’s ally VII spell. At 11th level, an elemental master can summon one greater elemental, two Huge elementals, or four Large or Medium elementals. This ability works like the summon nature’s ally VIII spell.
Energy Focus			KEY:Elemental Master ~ Energy Focus						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Elemental Master Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:At 3rd level, an elemental master adds 1 to the save DC of spells it casts with an energy descriptor corresponding to the dragon’s attuned energy type. This bonus increases by +1 for every additional three levels the elemental master gains (+2 at 6th level, +3 at 9th level, and +4 at 12th level), and it stacks with the bonus from the Spell Focus feat.
Energy Burst			KEY:Elemental Master ~ Energy Burst						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Elemental Master Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:A 4th-level elemental master can create a burst of damaging energy around its body. The burst consists of energy corresponding to the dragon’s attuned energy type and has a radius of 5 feet per class level of the dragon. Anything in the area takes 1d8 points of damage per class level of the dragon. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + dragon’s class level + its Con modifier) reduces the damage by half. Creating an energy burst counts as a use of the dragon’s breath weapon. It cannot breathe or create another burst for 1d4 rounds after creating a burst.
Energy Storm			KEY:Elemental Master ~ Energy Storm						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Elemental Master Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:A 7th-level elemental master can surround itself with a vortex of swirling energy corresponding to the dragon’s attuned energy type. The vortex extends from the dragon in an emanation with a radius of 5 feet per class level. The effect stops attacks with thrown weapons and projectiles. Such attacks fail if made by creatures inside the area, or if targeted at creatures within the area, or if their paths take them through the area. The storm deals 2 points of damage per class level to every unprotected creature within its area each round. The storm lasts for 1 round per class level (though the dragon can dismiss it as a move action), and counts as two uses of the dragon’s breath weapon. The dragon cannot use its breath weapon (or its energy burst ability) while the storm is in place and for 2d4 rounds after it subsides.
Spell-Like Ability		KEY:Elemental Master ~ Spell-Like Ability					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elemental Master Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:At 10th level, an elemental master gains a spell-like ability associated with its elemental subtype.

Increased Spell Resistance	KEY:Hidecarved Dragon ~ Increased Spell Resistance				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Hidecarved Dragon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.95	DESC:A hidecarved dragon adds its class level to its natural spell resistance. Dragons without natural spell resistance do not gain spell resistance when they adopt this class. However, if a hidecarved dragon with no natural spell resistance ages to the point where it gains spell resistance, it adds its class level to the natural spell resistance it gains at its new age category.
Suppress Weakness			KEY:Hidecarved Dragon ~ Suppress Weakness						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hidecarved Dragon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.95	DESC:At 2nd level, a hidecarved dragon gains Suppress Weakness (see page 74) as a bonus feat.
Poison Resistance			KEY:Hidecarved Dragon ~ Poison Resistance						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Hidecarved Dragon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.95	DESC:At 2nd level, a hidecarved dragon gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against poison.
Energy Resistance			KEY:Hidecarved Dragon ~ Energy Resistance						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Hidecarved Dragon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.95	DESC:At 3rd level, a hidecarved dragon gains resistance 10 to two energy types it is not already immune, vulnerable, or resistant to. The dragon can choose from resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic energy. For example, a gold hidecarved dragon could gain resistance to acid 10 and electricity 10.
Still Mind				KEY:Hidecarved Dragon ~ Still Mind							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Hidecarved Dragon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.95	DESC:At 4th level, a hidecarved dragon gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the enchantment school.
Natural Armor			KEY:Hidecarved Dragon ~ Natural Armor						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Hidecarved Dragon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.95	DESC:At 4th level, a hidecarved dragon’s natural armor bonus increases by +2. At 8th level the increase becomes +4, and at 12th level it becomes +6.
Increased Damage Reduction	KEY:Hidecarved Dragon ~ Increased Damage Reduction				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Hidecarved Dragon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.95	DESC:At 5th level, the amount of a hidecarved dragon’s natural damage reduction (the number before the slash) increases by 5, and its damage reduction can be overcome only by chaotic magic weapons. For example, a mature adult blue dragon/5th-level hidecarved dragon has damage reduction 15/magic and chaotic.
Extra Energy Immunity		KEY:Hidecarved Dragon ~ Extra Energy Immunity					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Hidecarved Dragon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.95	DESC:At 6th level, a hidecarved dragon gains immunity to an energy type it was already resistant to. Its resistance to one other energy type it has resistance 10 against increases to 20, and it gains resistance 10 against a third energy type. For this third energy type, a dragon with the fire subtype cannot choose cold, and a dragon with the cold subtype cannot choose fire. The gold hidecarved dragon from the earlier example could become immune to electricity at 6th level, increase its acid resistance to 20, and gain resistance to sonic 10. At 12th level, a hidecarved dragon’s energy resistances and immunities improve again. Its resistance 20 becomes immunity, its resistance 10 becomes resistance 20, and it gains resistance 10 to all other energy types (acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic) that it is not already immune or resistant to. The gold hidecarved dragon example, at 12th level, would have immunity to fire (naturally), electricity (since 6th level), and acid. It would have resistance to sonic 20 and cold 10.
Overcome Weakness			KEY:Hidecarved Dragon ~ Overcome Weakness						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hidecarved Dragon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:At 7th level, a hidecarved dragon gains Overcome Weakness (see page 72) as a bonus feat.
Death Ward				KEY:Hidecarved Dragon ~ Death Ward							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Hidecarved Dragon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:At 7th level, a hidecarved dragon gains the ability to use death ward on itself once per day as a cleric of its class level.
Wholeness of Body			KEY:Hidecarved Dragon ~ Wholeness of Body						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Hidecarved Dragon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:At 9th level, a hidecarved dragon can cure its own wounds. It can cure up to three times its class level in hit points each day and can spread this healing out among several uses.
Poison Immunity			KEY:Hidecarved Dragon ~ Poison Immunity						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Hidecarved Dragon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:At 10th level, a hidecarved dragon gains immunity to poison of all kinds.

For example, a mature adult blue dragon/11th-level hidecarved dragon has damage reduction 15/epic and chaotic.

# Sacred Warder of Bahamut	
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Sacred Warder of Bahamut ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sacred Warder of Bahamut Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:A sacred warder gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.
Divine Conversion			KEY:Sacred Warder of Bahamut ~ Divine Conversion						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sacred Warder of Bahamut Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:At 1st level, a sacred warder loses any effective sorcerer level it had previously gained by virtue of its age and draconic variety. Its effective divine spellcasting level increases by the number of sorcerer levels it sacrificed, allowing the dragon to cast cleric spells much more effectively. These effective levels apply only to the dragon’s spellcasting, not to other class abilities (such as turning undead or wild shape). For example, a very old gold dragon/1st-level cleric adopts the sacred warder of Bahamut prestige class. Its sorcerer caster level of 13th converts into thirteen effective cleric levels, giving the dragon the spellcasting ability of a 14th-level cleric.
Smite Evil Dragons		KEY:Sacred Warder of Bahamut ~ Smite Evil Dragons					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Sacred Warder of Bahamut Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:Once per day, a sacred warder of Bahamut of at least 2nd level may attempt to smite an evil dragon with one normal melee attack. It adds its Charisma bonus to its attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class level. If the sacred warder accidentally smites a dragon that is not evil, or a creature that is not a dragon, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day. A sacred warder can smite any creature of the dragon type that has an evil alignment. At 6th level, a sacred warder may smite evil dragons twice per day, and at 10th level it can do so three times per day.
Spellcasting			KEY:Sacred Warder of Bahamut ~ Spellcasting						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sacred Warder of Bahamut Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.97	DESC:From 2nd level on, when a new sacred warder level is gained, the dragon gains new spells per day as if it had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class it belonged to before it added the prestige class. It does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (an improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, wild shape, and so on). This essentially means that the dragon adds the level of sacred warder to the level of whatever divine spellcasting class the dragon has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If the dragon had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a sacred warder, the dragon must decide to which class it adds each level of sacred warder for the purpose of determining spells per day. A very old gold dragon/1st-level cleric/2nd-level sacred warder has the spellcasting ability of a 15th-level cleric: 13 from divine conversion of its sorcerer spellcasting levels, 1 from its single cleric level, and 1 from its two levels in the prestige class. If a dragon advances an age category after taking levels in this class, the added levels of spellcasting ability are added to its effective divine spellcasting level. If the very old gold dragon in the example above lives to be ancient, its spellcasting level would increase by 2, so it would cast spells as a 17th-level cleric.
Aura of Courage			KEY:Sacred Warder of Bahamut ~ Aura of Courage						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Sacred Warder of Bahamut Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.97	DESC:At 3rd level, a sacred warder becomes immune to fear effects. In addition, the dragon’s frightful presence ability alters so that it inspires allies as well as striking terror into enemies. Allies within the radius of the dragon’s aura (30 feet × its age category) are unaffected by the dragon’s frightful presence and receive a morale bonus on their saving throws against fear equal to the dragon’s class level + its Cha modifier. Allies within the aura cannot be panicked by an evil dragon’s frightful presence, regardless of their Hit Dice. Enemies within the aura are affected normally by the dragon’s frightful presence.
Sacred Shield			KEY:Sacred Warder of Bahamut ~ Sacred Shield						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Sacred Warder of Bahamut Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.97	DESC:At 7th level, a sacred warder gains the ability to surround itself with a protective aura that lasts 10 minutes and protects the dragon’s body and equipment from attacks. The shield absorbs 10 points of damage per class level. Once the shield absorbs that much damage, it collapses. The damage can be from any source—weapons, spells, any energy type, and so on. Damage the dragon would not take anyway (fire damage against a gold dragon, for example, or weapon damage blocked by the dragon’s damage reduction) does not count against the damage absorbed by the shield. The dragon can use this ability three times per day.
Area Sacred Shield		KEY:Sacred Warder of Bahamut ~ Area Sacred Shield					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Sacred Warder of Bahamut Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.97	DESC:At 12th level, a sacred warder of Bahamut can extend its sacred shield to protect an area with a radius of 30 feet. The dragon can place the barrier anywhere within its line of sight, and can choose to make it mobile with respect to an unattended object or willing creature (including the dragon itself ). The shield blocks incoming attacks, but creatures inside the shield can still attack out through the shield.

# Unholy Ravager of Tiamat
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.97	DESC:An unholy ravager gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.
Divine Conversion			KEY:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat ~ Divine Conversion						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.97	DESC:At 1st level, an unholy ravager loses any effective sorcerer level it had previously gained by virtue of its age and draconic variety. Its effective divine spellcasting level increases by the number of sorcerer levels it sacrificed, allowing the dragon to cast cleric spells much more effectively. These effective levels apply only to the dragon’s spellcasting, not to other class abilities (such as turning undead or wild shape). For example, a very old red dragon/1st-level cleric adopts the unholy ravager of Tiamat prestige class. Its sorcerer caster level of 13th converts into thirteen effective cleric levels in addition to its 1 level of cleric, giving the dragon the spellcasting ability of a 14th-level cleric.
Smite					KEY:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat ~ Smite								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:An unholy ravager of Tiamat adds its class levels to its cleric levels to determine its bonus on damage when using its smite ability (the granted power of the Destruction domain). At 4th level, 8th level, and 12th level, an unholy ravager can use its smite ability one additional time per day.
Spellcasting			KEY:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat ~ Spellcasting						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:From 2nd level on, when a new unholy ravager level is gained, the dragon gains new spells per day as if it had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class it belonged to before it added the prestige class. It does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (an improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, wild shape, and so on). This essentially means that the dragon adds the level of unholy ravager to the level of whatever divine spellcasting class the dragon has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If the dragon had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming an unholy ravager, the dragon must decide to which class it adds each level of unholy ravager for the purpose of determining spells per day. A very old red dragon/1st-level cleric/2nd-level unholy ravager has the spellcasting ability of a 15th-level cleric: 13 from divine conversion of its sorcerer spellcasting levels, 1 from its single cleric level, and 1 from its two levels in the prestige class. If a dragon advances an age category after taking levels in this class, the added levels of spellcasting ability are added to its effective divine spellcasting level. If the very old red dragon example above lives to be ancient, its spellcasting level would increase by 2, so it would cast spells as a 17th-level cleric.
Breath Weapon Substitution	KEY:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat ~ Breath Weapon Substitution				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Unholy Ravager of Tiamat Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:A 2nd-level unholy ravager of Tiamat can use breath weapon substitution at will. However, using this ability increases the number of rounds the dragon must wait before using its breath weapon again by 1 round, as if it were using a metabreath feat.
Aura of Despair			KEY:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat ~ Aura of Despair						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Unholy Ravager of Tiamat Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:At 3rd level, an unholy ravager’s frightful presence alters slightly. In addition to the fear effect, creatures within the radius of the dragon’s frightful presence take a –2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty is applied before creatures roll their saving throws against the frightful presence effect itself.
Profane Blast			KEY:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat ~ Profane Blast						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Unholy Ravager of Tiamat Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.99	DESC:At 7th level, an unholy ravager of Tiamat can unleash a narrow blast of raw profane energy from its mouth three times per day. The blast is a ray, requiring a ranged touch attack, with a range of 400 feet + 40 feet per class level. The blast looks and feels like energy of the same type as the dragon’s breath weapon. If it hits a target, it deals the same number of dice worth of damage as the dragon’s breath weapon, but uses d12s. (So, a great wyrm blue dragon would deal 24d12 points of damage with its profane blast.) The damage it deals results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by protection from energy and similar magic. Each use of this ability counts as a use of the dragon’s breath weapon, so it cannot use its breath weapon for 1d4 rounds after issuing a profane blast. An unholy ravager can target a creature behind a wall of force, prismatic wall, or prismatic sphere with its profane blast. The dragon makes a special dispel check, rolling 1d20 + its age category + its class level against a DC of 11 + the effect’s caster level. If this check is successful, the effect is instantly negated (all layers in a prismatic effect are destroyed) and the ray goes on to strike the intended target (if the ranged touch attack roll is successful). A profane blast is stopped normally by a sacred warder of Bahamut’s sacred shield.
Mass Profane Blast		KEY:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat ~ Mass Profane Blast					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Unholy Ravager of Tiamat Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.99	DESC:At 12th level, an unholy ravager of Tiamat’s profane blast occupies the same area as its breath weapon and affects all creatures within that area. The dragon can choose whether to use a ray profane blast or a mass profane blast, and can use both abilities no more than a total of three times per day. If a wall of force or prismatic effect is within the area of a mass profane blast, the dragon makes a special dispel check as described above for each such effect within the area.
