# TODO: Double Proficiency works for Feats
Barbed Dagger		KEY:Dagger (Barbed)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Dagger (Barbed)			SIZE:M	COST:35	WT:1	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Light.Piercing			DAMAGE:1d4	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	SPROP:Barbed daggers, as their name implies, look like normal daggers with long barbs covering the blade. The design makes the weapon more diffi cult to wield properly than a normal dagger, but it allows those skilled in the weapon's use to deal more damage with a well-placed attack. If you have 5 or more ranks in Sleight of Hand and use a barbed dagger, you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls on any successful sneak attack made with the weapon as it twists in the wound. This bonus also applies (and is therefore doubled) on successful critical hits with the weapon. Characters profi cient with the barbed dagger can treat it as a dagger for the purpose of any of the following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullEquip
Broadblade Short Sword	KEY:Sword (Short/Broadblade)	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Sword (Short/Broadblade)	SIZE:M	COST:75	WT:3	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Light.Piercing			DAMAGE:1d6	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	SOURCEPAGE:117	SPROP:Sword, Short, Broadblade: Broadblade short swords have a wider blade and crossguard than normal swords. This feature makes them more diffi cult to wield in combat, but the design allows skilled users to defend themselves better when fi ghting cautiously. If you are profi cient with the broadblade short sword and you fi ght defensively or employ the total defense combat maneuver, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC for the rest of the round in addition to the normal AC bonus from the combat maneuver (+2 for fi ghting defensively or +4 for total defense). This bonus also applies if you are profi cient with the weapon, have the Combat Expertise feat, and shift at least 2 points of your attack bonus to AC for the round. Because of its benefi t when fi ghting defensively, the broadblade short sword is a popular off-hand weapon. Characters profi cient with the broadblade short sword can treat it as a short sword for the purpose of any of the following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullEquip
Quickblade Rapier		KEY:Rapier (Quickblade)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Rapier (Quickblade)		SIZE:M	COST:75	WT:3	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.OneHanded.Piercing		DAMAGE:1d6	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:3	SOURCEPAGE:116	SPROP:Quickblade rapiers are longer and thinner than normal rapiers, with specially tapered blades and carefully balanced pommels. The design makes the weapon more diffi cult to wield properly than a normal rapier, but it allows those skilled in the weapon's use to disarm opponents more easily and to feint more effectively in combat. Most quickblade rapiers are at least masterwork in quality. If you are profi cient with the quickblade rapier, you gain a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails). You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks made to feint in combat. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat (see page 102 of the Player's Handbook) to apply your Dexterity modifi er instead of your Strength modifi er to attack rolls with a quickblade rapier sized for you. You can't use a quickblade rapier in two hands to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength modifi er to damage. Characters profi cient with the quickblade rapier can treat it as a rapier for the purpose of any of the following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullEquip
Longaxe			KEY:Longaxe				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Longaxe				SIZE:M	COST:35	WT:15	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.TwoHanded.Piercing		DAMAGE:1d12	CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1	SOURCEPAGE:115	SPROP:A longaxe looks like a greataxe with an elongated haft. This feature makes the weapon awkward to wield by those unfamiliar with its use, but those profi cient with the weapon can use the haft's extra length to attack foes more than 5 feet away as long as they are willing to forgo precision in favor of dealing extra damage. If you are profi cient with the longaxe, you can treat it as a reach weapon any time you use the Power Attack feat to shift 3 or more points of your attack bonus from attack to damage. When you use a longaxe in this manner, you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you cannot use it against an adjacent foe. Because you determine the use of the Power Attack feat for an entire turn, you must wield the longaxe as either a reach weapon or a normal weapon until the beginning of your next turn once you make the decision. You cannot wield it as both a reach weapon and a normal weapon in the same turn. Characters profi cient with the longaxe can treat it as a greataxe for the purpose of any of the following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullEquip
Longstaff			KEY:Longstaff			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Longstaff				SIZE:M	COST:15	WT:6	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.TwoHanded.Bludgeoning.Double		DAMAGE:1d6	ALTDAMAGE:1d6	ALTTYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.TwoHanded.Bludgeoning	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	SOURCEPAGE:116	SPROP:As its name implies, the longstaff is a longer version of the quarterstaff. The extra length makes the weapon much more diffi cult to use, but those skilled in its use are better able to protect themselves from multiple attackers when fi ghting cautiously. If you are profi cient with the longstaff and you fight defensively or employ the total defense combat maneuver, you cannot be fl anked for the rest of the round. This benefi t also applies if you are profi cient in the weapon, have the Combat Expertise feat, and shift at least 2 points of your attack bonus to AC for the round. A longstaff is a double weapon. You can fi ght with it as if fi ghting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fi ghting with two weapons, just as if you were fi ghting with a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see Two- Weapon Fighting, page 160 of the Player's Handbook). You can also strike with either end singly. A creature wielding a longstaff in one hand can't use it as a double weapon-only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round. The longstaff is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a longstaff special options (see the flurry of blows description, page 40 of the Player's Handbook). Characters proficient with the longstaff can treat it as a quarterstaff for the purpose of any of the following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullEquip
