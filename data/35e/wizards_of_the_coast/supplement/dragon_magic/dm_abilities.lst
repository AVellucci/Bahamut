###Block:
Frightful Presence	KEY:Aspect of Bahamut ~ Frightful Presence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Aspect of Bahamut Race Trait.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:An aspect of Bahamut can inspire terror by charging, attacking, or flying overhead. Creatures within 120 feet of the dragon that have 11 HD or fewer must attempt a DC 22 Will save. Success indicates that the target is immune to the aspect's frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds. Those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds.
Breath Weapon		KEY:Aspect of Bahamut ~ Breath Weapon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Aspect of Bahamut Race Trait.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once every 1d4 rounds, 40-ft. cone, 12d6 cold, Reflex DC 24 half.
Tempest Breath		KEY:Aspect of Bahamut ~ Tempest Breath		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Aspect of Bahamut Race Trait.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When an aspect of Bahamut chooses to use this feat (see Draconomicon) in conjunction with its breath weapon, creatures in the area that fail a DC 18 Fortitude save are affected as by a windstorm (DMG 95) in adddition to taking normal damage. Because the breath weapon has an instantaneous duration, creatures ignore the checked effect unless they are airborne (in which case they are blown back 1d6×5 feet). If an aspect uses this ability, it adds 1 to the number of rounds it must wait before using its breath weapon again.

Dragonbane			KEY:Wyrmbane Helm ~ Dragonbane		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:Starting at 10th level, you are anathema to dragons of all kinds. Any melee weapon you wield gains a +2 enhancement bonus and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage when you attack a creature of the dragon type. This benefit doesn't stack with the bane weapon special ability. In addition, any spell you cast that deals damage to a dragon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage to that dragon. If the spell allows a saving throw, the DC of the saving throw increases by 2. A successful save either halves or negates the extra damage, depending on how the normal damage dealt by the spell is affected by a successful save. A single spell can never deal this extra damage more than once per casting. However, if a spell deals damage for more than 1 round, it deals the extra damage in each round.

Creatures of 4 or fewer Hit Dice become panicked for 1 minute, and creatures of 5 or more Hit Dice become shaken for 1 minute. A successful Will save (DC 17 or 15 + your Cha modifier, whichever is higher) negates either effect. Whether the saving throw succeeds or fails, the creature is immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours. Dragons are immune to your frightful presence regardless of their Hit Dice.

Devour Spell	KEY:Spelleater ~ Devour Spell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spelleater Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.119	DESC:Any time a character casts a spell on a spelleater and does not overcome its spell resistance, the spelleater converts that spell energy into a boost for its own natural abilities. When a spelleater’s spell resistance blocks an incoming spell, the creature selects and gains one of the following benefits, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell. Multiple applications of the same benefit do not stack; instead, if the spelleater chooses the same benefit again before the first duration has elapsed, use the longer of the two durations. Combat Boost: The spelleater gains a +2 bonus on its melee attack rolls and damage rolls. Damage Reduction: The spelleater gains DR 5/ adamantine. Fast Healing: The spelleater gains fast healing 10. Magic Dampening: The spelleater generates a magicdampening field, causing all spellcasters within 60 feet to take a –2 penalty to their caster level.
