Race Traits ~ Aventi	CATEGORY:Internal		
#34
Water Spell Power (Ex): The magical ties that connect the aventi to Aventernus (see page 49) persist, untold ages since the sea god saved the aventi from extinction. As a result, spellcasting aventi have enchanced ability with water magic. An aventi's effective caster level is +1 for spells with the water descriptor.
Human Blood: For all effects related to race, an aventi is considered a human. Aventi are just as vulnerable to special effects that affect humans as humans are, and they can use magic items that are only usable by humans.

# Darfellan
Race Traits ~ Darfellan	CATEGORY:Internal		

#37
Hold Breath (Ex): A darfellan can hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to 8 ? his Constitution score before he risks drowning. For a typical darfellan, this is 96 rounds, or almost 10 minutes.
Natural Attack: A darfellan has a natural bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. If fighting without a weapon, a darfellan uses his bite as a primary attack, adding 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus to damage. If armed with a weapon, he can use his bite or weapon, as he chooses. When making a full attack, a darfellan normally uses the weapon as his primary attack along with the bite as a natural secondary attack (at -5 attack). If the darfellan gets extra attacks by virtue of a base attack bonus of +6 or higher, he gets them only with his primary attack.
Echolocation: In the water, a darfellan can emit a series of whistles, then instinctively pinpoint nearby creatures by hearing the echo. Darfellans have blindsense out to 20 feet, but the blindsense doesn't extend beyond the water.
Racial Hatred: A darfellan normally exudes a brooding calm, but the mere presence of a sahuagin is enough to send the darfellan into a blood-mad fury. Darfellans gain a +2 racial bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls when fighting sahuagin.
