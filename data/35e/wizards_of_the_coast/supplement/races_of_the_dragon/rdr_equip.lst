Bitterleaf Oil		COST:25			SOURCEPAGE:p.122	SPROP:Kobolds use this salve to keep their scales healthy and shiny. Each bottle of bitterleaf oil holds enough for ten applications. If the oil is applied each day (a full-round action), it staves off shedding indefinitely. In addition, on any day when bitterleaf oil is applied, the character naturally heals 1 additional point of damage per HD (max. 5) with a full night's rest.
Ditherbomb (Strong)	COST:300	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.122	SPROP:These are spherical explosive devices created by kobold alchemists to reduce large boulders to rubble during mining operations. They have also been adapted for military purposes. Activating a ditherbomb is move action that involves violently shaking the device, which explodes 1d3 rounds later. (Violently shaking the bearer of a ditherbomb often sets the bomb off as well.) Throwing a ditherbomb is a standard action. Deals deal 1d4x1d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 12 half) in a 10-foot-radius burst. The damage dealt by a ditherbomb ignores the hardness of stone
Ditherbomb (Weak)		COST:100	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.122	SPROP:These are spherical explosive devices created by kobold alchemists to reduce large boulders to rubble during mining operations. They have also been adapted for military purposes. Activating a ditherbomb is move action that involves violently shaking the device, which explodes 1d3 rounds later. (Violently shaking the bearer of a ditherbomb often sets the bomb off as well.) Throwing a ditherbomb is a standard action. Deals 1d6 points of acid damage to creatures and objects in a 5-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 10 half). The damage dealt by a ditherbomb ignores the hardness of stone
Ditherbomb (Wyrm)		COST:1000	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.122	SPROP:These are spherical explosive devices created by kobold alchemists to reduce large boulders to rubble during mining operations. They have also been adapted for military purposes. Activating a ditherbomb is move action that involves violently shaking the device, which explodes 1d3 rounds later. (Violently shaking the bearer of a ditherbomb often sets the bomb off as well.) Throwing a ditherbomb is a standard action. Deals 1d6?1d8 points of acid damage in a 15-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 15 half). The damage dealt by a ditherbomb ignores the hardness of stone
Fire Beetle Lamp		COST:10	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.123	SPROP:This lamp uses the luminous gland located above each eye of a fire beetle as its light source. Thanks to a special alchemical treatment, a fire beetle lamp shines as brightly as a common lamp (bright illumination out to 15 feet, shadowy illumination to 30 feet) and lasts for 6 days after creation. (Most fire beetle lamps are put into service immediately upon creation, but some unscrupulous merchants sell lamps after they have been used for a few days.) Kobold miners use these lamps when they need to see more than darkvision typically allows, specifically when color might be important.
Sundark Goggles		COST:10			SOURCEPAGE:p.123	SPROP:The smoked lenses of these goggles block light. They are typically fixed into a band of canvas that clasps together at the back to keep the goggles from falling off. Sundark goggles negate the dazzled condition experienced by a creature with light sensitivity while in bright illumination. As a side effect, they grant the wearer a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against gaze attacks. A creature wearing sundark goggles can't use a gaze attack, since other creatures can't see its eyes. Creatures without low-light vision or darkvision that wear sundark goggles take a -2 penalty on Search and Spot checks.

You resemble an ordinary member of your nondraconic race, negating any penalty on Disguise checks you would ordinarily take when disguising yourself as a different race.

# DRACONIC GRAFTS
Buffeting wings		COST:100000	TYPE:Draconic Graft	SOURCEPAGE:p.127	SPROP:You gain a fly speed equal to your base land speed with average maneuverability. You can't carry aloft more than a light load. If you already have wings, this benefit replaces your original fly speed and maneuverability. You can't use your buffeting wings to fly if you are wearing a shield (other than a buckler). You can also use buffeting wings to make up to two secondary slam attacks, but only while standing on the ground. Each attack deals damage as a wing attack made by dragon of your size (1d4 points for a Medium creature). You cannot attack with weapons held in your hands during the same round that you use buffeting wings (though you can use other natural attacks), and you can't use a wing to attack if that arm wears a shield (other than a buckler). In addition to the hit point cost, these wings reduce your overall agility, resulting in a permanent -2 penalty to Dexterity.
Dragonbone legs		COST:8000	TYPE:Draconic Graft	SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:You gain a +4 bonus on Climb, Jump, and Swim checks.
Dragonheart presence	COST:12000	TYPE:Draconic Graft	SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:You gain immunity to paralysis effects and the frightful presence of dragonkind. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information, and Intimidate checks you make involving a creature with the dragonblood subtype.
Frightful crest		COST:28000	TYPE:Draconic Graft	SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:When a frightful crest activates, any living nondragon enemy within 30 feet becomes panicked for 1 round if it has fewer Hit Dice than you; creatures with HD equal to or greater than yours are shaken for 1 round instead. A successful Will save negates this effect and renders the creature immune to your frightful crest for 24 hours; the save DC is 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifier. This is a mindaffecting fear effect. Characters who are immune to a dragon's frightful presence are also immune to a frightful crest
Glaring eye			COST:10000	TYPE:Draconic Graft	SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:You gain blindsense out to a distance of 30 feet and a +2 bonus on Search and Spot checks. You also gain immunity to magic sleep effects.
Gleaming scales		COST:9000	TYPE:Draconic Graft	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	SPROP:Your natural armor bonus to AC improves by 1. Because the graft improves your natural armor, an effect that provides an enhancement bonus to your natural armor (such as an amulet of natural armor) stacks with gleaming scales. Gleaming scales also provides resistance 5 to the same energy type to which the donor dragon's is immune or resistant, or it increases your existing resistance to that energy type (regardless of its origin) by 5. If the donor dragon has immunity or resistance to more than one kind of energy, choose which energy type to which you are resistant. If the donor dragon has no immunity or resistance to energy, the graft grants no resistance.
Metabolic fire		COST:56000	TYPE:Draconic Graft	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	SPROP:You gain a breath weapon, usable once every 1d4 rounds, that functions as described on page 306 of the Monster Manual. The form of the weapon (line or cone) is the same as that of the donor dragon; a cone-shaped breath weapon has a length of 30 feet, while a line-shaped breath weapon has a length of 60 feet. The breath weapon granted by metabolic fire deals 6d8 points of damage; a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + one-half your HD + your Con modifier) halves the damage. The damage type matches the type of energy damage dealt by the donor dragon. Despite the name of the graft, it can deal any type of energy damage associated with the donor dragon.
Resilient scales		COST:70000	TYPE:Draconic Graft	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	SPROP:Resilient scales grants resistance 30 to the same type of energy as the donor dragon's immunity. If the donor dragon has immunity to more than one kind of energy, the creator chooses which energy type the graft provides resistance against. If you have at least one other draconic graft, resilient scales counts as two grafts for the purpose of determining the damage reduction granted by your draconic grafts. For example, if you have resilient scales and dragonheart presence, you would have DR 2/magic (as if you had three draconic grafts).
Smashing tail		COST:30000	TYPE:Draconic Graft	SOURCEPAGE:p.130	SPROP:Your tail can make a secondary slam attack that deals damage as a dragon one size category larger than you (1d8 for a Medium creature), adding 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus to the damage. Your tail also provides you with a +2 bonus on Balance checks and Swim checks.
Taloned arm			COST:34000	TYPE:Draconic Graft	SOURCEPAGE:p.130	SPROP:You can use a taloned arm to make a secondary claw attack that deals damage as a dragon of your size (1d6 for a Medium creature). When making a full attack, you can attack with your claw in addition to any other attacks you make.
