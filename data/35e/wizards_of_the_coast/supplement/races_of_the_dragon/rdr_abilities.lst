PRETEXT:Only kobolds can undergo the Draconic Rite of Passage. A kobold requires no one else to perform the rite; it is a solitary activity.	BENEFIT:Upon completing this rite, a kobold chooses any 1st-level sorcerer spell. He can now use that spell once per day as a spell-like ability, using his character level as his caster level. Each day, a kobold must complete the Searching for the Dragon meditation (see above) in order to recharge this spell-like ability for the day. No kobold can benefi t from this rite more than once. Time: A kobold who undergoes this rite must fi rst endure nine days of fasting. Immediately thereafter, the kobold must succeed on a DC 10 Concentration check to enter a deep trance that lasts for 24 hours. If the check fails, the rite must begin anew. Cost: This rite requires sacrifi cing a gem of at least 100 gp in value. The kobold also permantly loses 1 hit point upon completion of the rite.

In the same way that chromatic and metallic dragons gain integrated levels of sorcerer spellcasting as they age, this ritual allows kobolds to awaken a small amount of their own arcane might.	PRETEXT:Only kobolds of 6 Hit Dice or more, sorcerer level 1st, who have successfully completed the Draconic Rite of Passage, and taken Draconic Reservoir (1) can undergo the Greater Draconic Rite of Passage. A kobold requires no one else to perform the rite; it is a solitary activity.	BENEFIT:Upon completing this rite, a kobold gains new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known) as if also gaining one level in the sorcerer class. The kobold does not, however, gain any other benefit a sorcerer would have gained (familiar abilities, and so on). The benefit of this ritual is automatically factored into the 15 minutes that a kobold sorcerer spends concentrating to ready their daily allotment of spells. No kobold can benefit from this rite more than once. Time: A kobold who undergoes this rite must first endure nine days of fasting (the equivalent of three days for a kobold in a region above 40 degrees F). Immediately thereafter, the kobold must succeed on a DC 20 Concentration check to enter a deep trance that lasts for 24 hours. If the check fails, the rite must begin a new. Cost: This rite requires sacrificing a gem of at least 1,000 gp in value. The kobold also permanently loses 3 hit points upon completion of the rite, the price of unlocking latent draconic energy within their soul.	BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|-3	BONUS:PCLEVEL|Sorcerer|1

(See the monk class feature, pages 40-41 of the Player's Handbook.) If you don't have any monk levels, you are treated as a monk of the same class level as your disciple class level for determining your unarmored speed bonus.
Flurry of Blows			KEY:Disciple of the Eye ~ Flurry of Blows			SOURCEPAGE:p.76	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.Disciple of the EyeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Your disciple of the eye levels stack with your monk levels (if any) for the purpose of determining the attack bonuses you use when making a fl urry of blows.

If you don't have any monk levels, you are treated as a monk of the same class level as your disciple class level for determining your fl urry of blows attack bonuses.
Wandering Eyes			KEY:Disciple of the Eye ~ Wandering Eyes			SOURCEPAGE:p.76	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.ClassFeature.Disciple of the EyeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As a disciple of the eye, you gain the ability to remotely perceive your surroundings. As a standard action, you can create a magical sensor that provides visual information as the arcane eye spell (PH 173), for up to 1 minute per day per disciple level (which can be expended gradually, minimum 1 round). The effect of this ability is identical to that of the arcane eye spell, except that the magical sensor is shaped like a dragon of Fine size. The moment you stop concentrating on the invisible sensor, it winks out of existence and must be created again.

Frightful Attack			KEY:Disciple of the Eye ~ Frightful Attack		SOURCEPAGE:p.76	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.Disciple of the EyeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, you can unsettle your foes by evoking the presence of the dragon within you. This ability takes effect automatically whenever you make an attack roll against an opponent that has fewer Hit Dice than your character level. The target of your attack must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifi er) or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Dragons and creatures with the dragonblood subtype are immune to this effect. Creatures that succeed on this save can't be affected again by your frightful attack for 24 hours.
Keen Senses				KEY:Disciple of the Eye ~ Keen Senses			SOURCEPAGE:p.76	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.Disciple of the EyeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When you attain 3rd level, your senses dramatically improve. You can see four times as well as a human can in shadowy illumination, and twice as well as a human can see in normal light. If you can already see farther than a human but not as well as indicated above, your vision extends to this improved distance. If you already have improved vision that matches or exceeds this distance, your vision does not improve. You also gain darkvision out to 120 feet. If you already have darkvision but not out to 120 feet, your current darkvision extends to that distance. If your current darkvision already extends to 120 feet or more, your darkvision does not improve.	BONUS:VAR|DarkvisionRange|120|TYPE=Base
Glare of the Enraged Dragon	KEY:Disciple of the Eye ~ Glare of the Enraged Dragon	SOURCEPAGE:p.77	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.Disciple of the EyeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level, you can use a swift action (see page 122) and focus your dragon heritage into an enraged glare that you direct against any creature within 30 feet. The target of your glare must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier) or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to your disciple level. Affected foes that are already shaken become frightened instead.
Blindsense				KEY:Disciple of the Eye ~ Blindsense			SOURCEPAGE:p.77	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.Disciple of the EyeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, your senses dramatically expand. You gain blindsense out to 30 feet. If you already have blindsense out to 30 feet or more, the range of the ability does not improve.	BONUS:VAR|BlindsenseRange|30|TYPE=Base

# Dracolexi
Spellcasting						KEY:Dracolexi ~ Spellcasting		SOURCEPAGE:p.79	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.DracolexiClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At each level beyond 1st, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a dracolexi, you must decide which class to add each level to for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Draconic Words	SORTKEY:Draconic Words A	KEY:Dracolexi ~ Draconic Words	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.DracolexiClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When you enter this class, you begin to discover the arcane nuances that allow specifi c spoken Draconic words to produce powerful effects. Your intuitive understanding of how to express these words cannot be imparted to others. Even if one of these words is repeated perfectly by someone else, the utterance has no effect, because the speaker lacks the internalized understanding that can only come from the special studies that dracolexi engage in. At 1st level and every three levels thereafter (4th, 7th, and 10th), you can learn one Draconic word from among those described below in order to use it and gain the benefi t of its effect. Some Draconic words have a class level requirement that must be met before the word can be learned. You can't learn the same word twice. Speaking a word is a swift action (see page 122) that activates the word's effect; if the word affects a particular creature, you can target any creature (including yourself) within 30 feet. A silence spell or similar effect prevents you from using Draconic words; if you are deafened, you have a 20%% chance of misspeaking a Draconic word when using it (this counts as a use of the word but has no effect). Beginning at 4th level, you can choose to incorporate a known Draconic word into the verbal component of a spontaneously cast arcane spell as you cast it (which requires no action other than the normal casting of the spell). In this case, the word takes effect at the end of the spell's casting time, just before the spell takes effect. If the Draconic word would normally target a specifi c creature, it can only target a creature that is targeted by the spell, or a single creature within the area of the spell. A spell cast without a verbal component can't have a Draconic word added to its effect. You can use each Draconic word any number of times per day, but no more than one word can be used each round (nor can you use the same word more than once per round). No creature can be targeted by the same Draconic word twice in a 24-hour period. If a saving throw is allowed against the power of the Draconic word, the save DC is 10 + your dracolexi level + your Cha modifi er.

The target regains one spell slot (but not a slot that held a prepared spell) of the highest level of arcane spell it can cast spontaneously. If the target has not already cast any spells of that level, it instead regains one spell slot of the highest arcane spell level for which it has already spontaneously cast a spell.

Bonus Feat			KEY:Dracolexi ~ Bonus Feat		SOURCEPAGE:p.80	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.DracolexiClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A dracolexi learns how to rely on little but her own voice to cast spells. At 2nd level, you gain your choice of Eschew Materials or Still Spell as a bonus feat. If you already have these feats, you gain nothing from this class feature.
Power Word Spells		KEY:Dracolexi ~ Power Word Spells	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.DracolexiClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The words of Draconic power share some fundamental similarities to the various power word spells (those in the Player's Handbook as well as the ten new power word spells presented in Chapter 7 of this book), and your studies shed new light on the use of these magical effects. At 3rd level, you can select any single power word spell and add it to the spell list of any one spontaneous arcane spellcasting class that you have, treating it as a spell of one level lower than normal. If your class spell list doesn't normally include spells of the (adjusted) level of the power word spell, you can't add it to your spell list. For example, a 5th-level bard/3rd-level dracolexi could select power word distract (see page 115). It is normally a 4th-level spell, but he can treat it as a 3rdlevel bard spell. He could even choose power word blind (normally a 7th-level spell) and add it to his class spell list as a 6th-level bard spell, despite the fact that he is not yet capable of casting 6th-level bard spells. He couldn't choose power word kill or power word stun with this ability, since even with the adjustment these would be 8th-level and 7th-level spells, respectively, which aren't normally available to bards. Furthermore, if you are (or become) capable of casting spells of that level, you can also add the power word spell to your list of spells known. If you already know the selected power word spell, you can move that spell to one level lower on your class spell list and also add any spell of the power word spell's original level to your spell list. The bard in the previous example couldn't add power word disable (normally a 5th-level spell) to his list of spells known until he was capable of casting 4th-level bard spells. A 9th-level sorcerer/3rd-level dracolexi, on the other hand, could immediately add power word disable to his list of spells known, since he is capable of casting 4th-level spells. If he already knew power word disable as a 5th-level spell, he would add it to his list of 4th-level spells known and then add a different 5th-level sorcerer spell of his choice to his spells known list. At 6th level and again at 9th level, you can select another power word spell in this fashion.
Bonus Spells Known	KEY:Dracolexi ~ Bonus Spells Known	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.DracolexiClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A dracolexi is particularly talented in using spells that incorporate language and speech. At 5th level, you can add any two languagedependent spells from your class's spell list to your list of spells known for that class. The spells must be of a level you are capable of casting, and the two spells must be of different levels. For example, a 5th-level sorcerer/5th-level dracolexi could add lesser geas (a 4th-level sorcerer spell) and suggestion (a 3rd-level sorcerer spell) to his list of spells known. He couldn't learn command (since it's a cleric spell) or mass suggestion (since it's a 6th-level spell and beyond his ability to cast).
Voice in Silence		KEY:Dracolexi ~ Voice in Silence	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.DracolexiClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When coupled with arcane energy, your voice becomes potent enough to temporarily overcome areas of silence or even your own deafness. Beginning at 8th level, you can expend an arcane spell slot as a move action to suppress all silence spells (or similar effects) in your space, and to render your voice audible to you and other creatures sharing your space even if you or they are deafened. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended. Only you (and any other creatures sharing your space) benefit from this effect; adjacent creatures that are deafened or within a silence effect are still affected by the deafness or silence. The effect moves with you.

# Dragon Devotee

Ability Increase		KEY:Dragon Devotee ~ Ability Increase	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.Dragon DevoteeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When you enter this class, your Charisma score increases by 2 points. At 3rd level, your Constitution score improves by 2 points. At 5th level, your Strength score improves by 2 points.
Natural Armor		KEY:Dragon Devotee ~ Natural Armor		SOURCEPAGE:p.84	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.Dragon DevoteeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A dragon devotee's skin thickens and toughens, developing minuscule scales. This change provides a +1 bonus to your existing natural armor bonus to AC, or simply a +1 natural armor bonus if you had no natural armor to begin with.
Combat Technique		KEY:Dragon Devotee ~ Combat Technique	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.Dragon DevoteeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level and again at 4th level, you become more deadly in combat. Each time you gain this class feature, you can choose either to take a bonus feat (any feat from the list of fi ghter bonus feats for which you meet the prerequisite) or to improve the extra damage dealt by your existing sneak attack, skirmish, or sudden strike class feature by 1d6. (The skirmish class feature is described in the scout class, and the sudden strike class feature is found in the ninja class; both of these classes appear in Complete Adventurer.) You must already have the sneak attack, skirmish, or sudden strike class feature in order to choose this option. If you have more than one of these class features, you must apply the bonus to a single class feature (but you can choose a different class feature at 4th level from what you chose at 2nd level).
Draconic Resistance	KEY:Dragon Devotee ~ Draconic Resistance	SOURCEPAGE:p.85	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.Dragon DevoteeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, you become resistant to paralysis and magic sleep effects, gaining a +4 bonus on saves against such effects.
Ignore Spell Failure	KEY:Dragon Devotee ~ Ignore Spell Failure	SOURCEPAGE:p.85	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.Dragon DevoteeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Normally, armor of any type interferes with an arcane spellcaster's gestures, which can cause his spells to fail if those spells have somatic components. Beginning at 3rd level, you can ignore the arcane spell failure chance when casting 0-level and 1st-level arcane spells. This benefi t doesn't apply to spells higher than 1st level, including 0-level or 1st-level spells that occupy a higher-level spell slot because of the application of a metamagic feat.
Spellcasting		KEY:Dragon Devotee ~ Spellcasting		SOURCEPAGE:p.85	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Dragon DevoteeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level and 5th level, you gain spells per day, spells known, and an increase in caster level as if you had also gained a level in sorcerer. You do not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained. If you don't have any levels in sorcerer before reaching 3rd level in this class, you gain spells per day, spells known, and an increase in caster level as if you were a 1st-level sorcerer. You use all the normal rules for sorcerer spellcasting as described in the Player's Handbook. Upon reaching 3rd level in this class, you add magic fang to your sorcerer spell list as a 1st-level spell and greater magic fang to your sorcerer spell list as a 3rd-level spell. You can choose these spells as spells known (assuming, in the latter case, that you are able to know and cast 3rdlevel sorcerer spells), and you can use spell trigger items such as wands that contain these spells.
Claws				KEY:Dragon Devotee ~ Claws			SOURCEPAGE:p.85	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.Dragon DevoteeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level, you gain two claw attacks that each deal damage according to your size (see the table below). If you already have claw attacks, use the value given here or your existing claw damage, whichever is greater. These claws are primary attacks unless you already have secondary claw attacks, in which case they remain as secondary attacks.
Draconic Template		KEY:Dragon Devotee ~ Draconic Template	SOURCEPAGE:p.85	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Dragon DevoteeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, you gain all the abilities of the draconic creature template (see page 74) that you have not already gained as dragon devotee class features-except that you do not apply the template's level adjustment. Specifi cally, you gain the dragonblood subtype in addition to any subtype you might already have. You also gain darkvision out to 60 feet, low-light vision, and a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks and Spot checks.

# Dragonheart Mage
Draconic Breath	KEY:Dragonheart Mage ~ Draconic Breath	SOURCEPAGE:p.88	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.Dragonheart MageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, you gain the Draconic Breath feat. As a dragonheart mage, you realize some additional benefi ts from taking this feat. As stated in the feat description on page 102, you can use a standard action to change arcane spell energy into a breath weapon that deals 2d6 points of damage per level of the spell that you expend. As you gain levels in this prestige class, however, the amount of damage you can deal increases. At 6th level, your breath weapon deals 2d8 points of damage per level of the spell you give up. At 10th level, your breath weapon deals 3d6 points of damage per level of the spell you give up.
Spellcasting	KEY:Dragonheart Mage ~ Spellcasting		SOURCEPAGE:p.89	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Dragonheart MageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At each level except 1st and 6th, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a dragonheart mage, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Draconic Feat	KEY:Dragonheart Mage ~ Draconic Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.89	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Dragonheart MageClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd, 4th, and 8th level, you gain a bonus draconic feat. Choose any draconic feat for which you meet the prerequisite, as given on page 99.

# Singer of Concordance
Spellcasting		KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Spellcasting			SOURCEPAGE:p.91	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Singer of ConcordanceClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At each level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a Singer of Concordance, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Aspect of Peace		KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Aspect of Peace		SOURCEPAGE:p.91	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.Singer of ConcordanceClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Upon entering this class, you attune yourself to the great Song of Io and to one Sphere of Concordance that is sustained by Io's song. In so doing, you draw that sphere's aspect of peace spiritually closer to you and the reality you inhabit. This effect is always active while you are conscious (and the effect moves with you), but not if you are unconscious or dead. It grants you immunity to the fi rst compulsion effect (magical or otherwise) that would otherwise affect you each day, and for the remainder of the day grants you a +4 morale bonus on saving throws to resist further compulsion effects. Each ally within 10 feet of you at any time during the day feels a refl ection of the Sphere of Concordance's aspect of peace and gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against compulsion effects. As you gain levels as a Singer of Concordance, you gain the ability to call up additional aspects of a Sphere of Concordance. As this occurs, you can enjoy multiple aspects operating simultaneously, without confl ict. In fact, the more aspects called into existence, the closer you draw to your chosen Sphere of Concordance .
Bonus Domain		KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Bonus Domain			SOURCEPAGE:p.92	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Singer of ConcordanceClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, you gain access to an additional cleric domain from the following list of domains: Dragon*, Healing, Knowledge, Magic, Strength, Travel, or Wealth. You gain the granted power associated with the domain you choose, and you can select the spells in that domain as your daily domain spells. *Domain described in Draconomicon, page 107.
Aspect of Refuge		KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Aspect of Refuge		SOURCEPAGE:p.92	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.Singer of ConcordanceClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level, you increase your attunement to your sphere, allowing you to call upon its aspect of refuge. You can call up this effect as a standard action, and dismiss it as a swift action (see page 122) or as a free action made in conjunction with attacking any other creature (automatic dismissal), or by moving more than 20 feet from where you first called up the aspect of refuge. All creatures within 20 feet of you that attempt to strike or otherwise target any other creature, even with a spell, must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifi er). If the save succeeds, the creature can attack normally and is not affected. If the save fails, the creature can't follow through with the attack. That part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack another creature while it remains within the refuge. Creatures that do not attempt to target another creature with an attack or other effect remain unaffected. The refuge does not prevent creatures within 20 feet of you from being attacked or affected by area or effect spells, or from other attacks launched from farther away. You can use nonattack spells or otherwise act within the refuge without dismissing it. For instance, you could heal wounds, cast a bless spell, perform an augury, or summon creatures.
Aspect of Exclusion	KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Aspect of Exclusion		SOURCEPAGE:p.92	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.ClassFeature.Singer of ConcordanceClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, you further increase your attunement to your sphere, allowing you to call upon its aspect of exclusion once per day for a period of up to 1 round per caster level. You can call up this effect as a standard action, and dismiss it as a swift action or by moving more than 10 feet from where you fi rst called up the aspect of exclusion. The aspect of exclusion appears as an immobile, faintly shimmering sphere that surrounds you and all creatures within 10 feet of you. This aspect prevents all spell effects of 4th level or lower from entering the sphere. This effect is otherwise identical to globe of invulnerability (and is considered a 6th-level spell effect). After reaching 8th level, you can use this ability twice per day.	ASPECT:NAME|Aspect of Exclusion %1/day|AspectOfExclusionTimes	DEFINE:AspectOfExclusionTimes|0
Aspect of Healing		KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Aspect of Healing		SOURCEPAGE:p.92	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.Singer of ConcordanceClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 6th level, you become able to call upon your sphere's aspect of healing. This aspect is always active while you are conscious (and the effect moves with you), but not if you are unconscious or dead. Any healing performed within 10 feet of you (and any healing you initiate) cures an additional 1d8 points. Undead within 10 feet of you that are dealt damage by a cure spell take an additional 1d8 points of damage.
Aspect of Safety		KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Aspect of Safety		SOURCEPAGE:p.93	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.Singer of ConcordanceClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 9th level, you can call upon your sphere's aspect of safety once per day for a period of up to 1 minute per caster level. You can call up the effect as a standard action, and dismiss it as a swift action or by moving more than 10 feet from where you fi rst called up the aspect of safety. The area within the 10-foot-radius sphere surrounding you is impervious to planar travel of any sort, except if such travel is initiated by you. The effect also deals 6d6 points of damage to creatures that attempt to enter it other than those you designate. A Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifi er) halves the damage dealt. An undesignated creature within the sphere takes no further damage beyond the initial 6d6 points, unless it exits and then attempts to reenter.

Sphere of Concordance	KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Sphere of Concordance	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.ClassFeature.Singer of ConcordanceClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, you perfect your unison with the great Song. You gain the ability to transport you and up to eight willing companions to and from a particular Sphere of Concordance at will. This effect is considered a 7th-level spell effect. See the sidebar for a description of the environment found within a Sphere of Concordance.
