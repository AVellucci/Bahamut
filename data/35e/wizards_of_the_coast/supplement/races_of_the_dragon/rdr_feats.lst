You can apply the selected metamagic feat to any spontaneously cast spell without increasing the casting time.

You can also handle, train, and rear animals with the draconic template as if they were animals (rather than magical beasts). Even with this feat, dragons can't be reared with the Handle Animal skill. (For information on rearing dragons, see page 13 of Draconomicon.) Normal: Without this feat, only animals and magical beasts with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 can be handled and trained with the Handle Animal skill, and using Handle Animal on a magical beast is done with a -4 penalty on the check.

In addition, you can use your wings to glide, negating damage from a fall from any height and allowing 20 feet of forward travel for every 5 feet of descent. You glide at a speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. Even if your maneuverability improves, you can't hover while gliding. You can't glide while carrying a medium or heavy load. If you become unconscious or helpless while in midair, your wings naturally unfurl, and powerful ligaments stiffen them. You descend in a tight corkscrew and take only 1d6 points of falling damage, no matter what the actual distance of the fall. Special: Unlike most feats, this feat must be taken at 1st level, during character creation. A kobold with the Dragonwrought feat can take this feat at 3rd level.

You retain all your other subtypes and your kobold racial traits. Your scales become tinted with a color that matches that of your draconic heritage. As a dragon, you are immune to magic sleep and paralysis effects. You have darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision. You gain a +2 racial bonus on the skill indicated for your draconic heritage on the table on page 103. Special: Unlike most feats, this feat must be taken at 1st level, during character creation.

You can't fly while carrying a medium or heavy load or while fatigued or exhausted. You can safely fly for a number of consecutive rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). You can exert yourself to fly for up to twice as long, but then you're fatigued at the end of the flight. You are likewise fatigued after spending a total of more than 10 minutes per day flying. Because you can glide before, after, and between rounds of actual flight, you can remain aloft for extended periods, even if you can only use flight for 1 round at a time without becoming fatigued. When you reach 12 HD, you have enough stamina and prowess to fly for longer periods. You can fly at a speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability), and flying requires no more exertion than walking or running. You can make a dive attack. A dive attack works like a charge, but you must fly a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. You can make a dive attack only when wielding a piercing weapon; if the attack hits, it deals double damage. You can use the run action while flying, provided you fly in a straight line.

Also, you can sleep in medium armor without becoming fatigued. Normal: A character without this feat who sleeps in medium armor is automatically fatigued the next day. Special: A kobold who would gain Endurance as a bonus feat can choose Kobold Endurance in its place. Kobold Endurance counts as the Endurance feat for the purpose of meeting a prerequisite for a feat, prestige class, or special ability.

###Block: 	Breath Channeling
Entangling Exhalation	TYPE:Breath	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:You can use your breath weapon to create an entangling mesh of energy.	PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, breath weapon.	PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Dragon,RACESUBTYPE=Dragonblood	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon	BENEFIT:When you use your breath weapon, you can choose to enmesh all creatures in its area instead of producing its normal effect. Your breath weapon deals only half its normal damage; however, any creature that takes damage from your breath weapon becomes entangled and takes an extra 1d6 points of damage, of the same energy type as normally dealt by your breath weapon, each round at the start of your turn. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. If your breath weapon doesn't deal energy damage, creatures damaged by the initial breath are still entangled but don't take additional damage on later rounds.
Exhaled Barrier	TYPE:Breath	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:You can use your breath weapon to create a wall of energy.	PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, breath weapon.	PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Dragon,RACESUBTYPE=Dragonblood	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon	BENEFIT:When you use your breath weapon, you can choose to create a 10-foot-by-10-foot vertical plane of energy instead of producing its normal effect. The opaque wall's near endpoint begins at any corner of your space and extends in a straight line for 10 feet or until it contacts a solid surface. The wall lasts for 1d4 rounds. Any creature passing through the wall takes damage equal to that normally dealt by your breath weapon. If you create the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Either way, a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Con modifier) halves this damage. If your breath weapon doesn't deal energy damage, the wall deals fire damage. If your breath weapon doesn't deal damage, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage.

Activating this ability is a free action; the effect lasts until your rage ends or until you use your breath weapon again. While this feat is in effect, your bite attacks deal an extra 2d6 points of energy damage, matching the energy type of your breath weapon. If your breath weapon doesn't deal energy damage, this damage is fire damage.

Any creature in the area can make a Reflex save (DC 10 + level of the spell used + your Cha modifier) for half damage. This is a supernatural ability.

Persistence: To use this maneuver, you must cast a specific spell two or more times in succession, and the spell must be one that allows affected creatures or objects a saving throw. You can take a move action after casting the spell once before casting it again, but you cannot take any other standard actions between successive castings. On the second and subsequent times you cast the spell, you add a cumulative +1 to the spell's save DC. If you cast any other spell after starting to use this feat or take any other standard action, the persistence chain breaks and you must begin anew. Refined Targeting: To use this maneuver, you must cast a specific spell two or more times in succession, and the spell must be one that requires an attack roll to affect a target. You can take a move action after casting the spell once before casting it again, but you cannot take any other standard actions between successive castings. On the second and subsequent times you cast the spell at the same target, you gain a cumulative +2 enhancement bonus on the attack roll to deliver the spell. If you cast any spell that does not require an attack roll or take any other standard action, the refined targeting chain breaks and you must begin anew. Persistent Targeting: To use this maneuver, you must cast a specific spell two or more times in succession, and the spell must be one that allows a target to apply spell resistance to the effect. You can take a move action after casting the spell once before casting it again, but you cannot take any other standard actions between successive castings. On the second and subsequent times you cast the spell at the same target, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome the target's spell resistance.

On the round after the charge, you can flutter your wings in a distracting manner while you make a melee attack or attacks against the same opponent you charged. If that opponent fails a DC 20 Reflex save, you gain a +2 bonus for your turn on your melee attack rolls against the distracted opponent. You cannot make a wing buffet again until after you make another charge. Wing Defense: To use this maneuver, you must have taken the total defense action. On the round after doing so, if you do not use your wings to fly, you can flutter your wings in such a way as to gain concealment for the round. Wing Fan: To use this maneuver, you must have used at least one move action in the previous round to fly or glide at least 30 feet. As a full-round action in the next round, you can use your wings to produce an effect identical to a gust of wind spell with a range of 30 feet. Using this maneuver makes you fatigued.
