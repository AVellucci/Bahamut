PEARL OF INCARNUM POWER							TYPE:Incarnum																																							SPROP:Certain relics particularly suited for a soulcaster's skills have been passed down from mentors to novitiates for centuries. Among these are pearls of incarnum power, which look like typical pearls except for a slightly cloudy sheen on their surfaces. Like a pearl of power, a pearl of incarnum power enables the possessor to recall any one spell that he has already prepared and then cast. In addition, however, he can restore any essentia that was previously invested in that spell as part of the same action used to recall it. The spell is then prepared again, with its invested essentia, just as if it had not been cast. Each pearl of incarnum power functions once per day, and only for spells of a particular level. Strong transmutation; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be able to cast spells of the spell level to be recalled, creator must have an essentia pool; Price 1,500 gp (1st), 6,000 gp (2nd), 13,500 gp (3rd), 24,000 gp (4th), 37,500 gp (5th), 54,000 gp (6th), 73,500 gp (7th), 96,000 gp (8th), 121,500 gp (9th).
