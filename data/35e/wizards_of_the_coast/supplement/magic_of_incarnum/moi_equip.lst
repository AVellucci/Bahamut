PEARL OF INCARNUM POWER
Certain relics particularly suited for a soulcaster's skills
have been passed down from mentors to novitiates for
centuries. Among these are pearls of incarnum power, which
look like typical pearls except for a slightly cloudy sheen
on their surfaces. Like a pearl of power, a pearl of incarnum
power enables the possessor to recall any one spell that he
has already prepared and then cast. In addition, however,
he can restore any essentia that was previously invested
in that spell as part of the same action used to recall it.
The spell is then prepared again, with its invested essentia,
just as if it had not been cast. Each pearl of incarnum
power functions once per day, and only for spells of a
particular level.
