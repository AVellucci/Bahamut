#183 TEMPLATE
CREATING A LOST
"Lost" is an acquired template that can be added to any living
creature with an Intelligence score of at least 3 (referred to
hereafter as the base creature).
A lost uses all the base creature's statistics and abilities
except as noted here.
Size and Type: A lost's type does not change, but it gains
the incarnum subtype. Size is unchanged.
Speed: The creature's base land speed increases by 10 ft.
Though a lost might stumble and twitch, it can be surprisingly
nimble when closing for a kill. Any swim, fly, or burrow
speeds the base creature might have do not increase.
Armor Class: The base creature's natural armor bonus
improves by 3.
Attack: A lost retains all the attacks of the base creature
and also gains a slam attack if it didn't already have one.
If the base creature can use weapons, the lost retains this
ability. A creature with natural weapons retains those
natural weapons. A lost fighting without weapons uses
either its slam attack or its primary natural weapon (if it
has any). A lost armed with a weapon uses its slam or a
weapon, as it desires.
Full Attack: A lost fighting without weapons uses either
its slam attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any).
If armed with a weapon, it uses the weapon as its primary
attack along with a slam or other natural weapon as a natural
secondary attack.
Damage: Losts have slam attacks. If the base creature does
not have this attack form, use the appropriate damage value
from the table below according to the lost's size. If the base
creature already had a slam attack, it retains its old damage
value or uses the appropriate value from the table below,
whichever is better. A lost's natural weapon attacks deal the
same base damage as the corresponding attacks of the base
creature did.
Size Base Slam Damage
Up to Tiny 1
Small 1d3
Medium 1d4
Large 1d6
Huge 1d8
Gargantuan 2d6
Colossal 2d8
Special Attacks: A lost has all the special attacks of the
base creature, except for any spells that it can no longer
cast because of its reduced Intelligence score. In addition,
it gains a new special attack based on the particular
emotion that has been fused to its soul, as given on the
following table.
Emotion Special Attack
Despair Mirror of despair
Hatred Bile of hatred
Misery Song of misery
Wrath Fury of wrath
Bile of Hatred (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a hateful lost
can spew acidic bile in a 30-foot cone as a standard action.
Every creature in the area takes 1d4 points of acid damage
per character level of the lost. A successful Reflex save halves
this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Fury of Wrath (Ex): A wrathful lost automatically enters
a ragelike state on its first turn in combat. While in this
state, it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to
twice its character level and a bonus on damage rolls equal
to one-half its character level (rounded up). Its fury lasts
for 10 rounds.
Mirror of Despair (Ex): The gaze of a despairing lost is unsettling
to sentient creatures. Any creature with an Intelligence
score of 3 or higher that is within 30 feet of the lost and can
see it must make a Will save or become shaken for 2d6 rounds.
Success indicates that the creature cannot be affected again
by the same lost's mirror of despair for 24 hours. Mirror
of despair is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Song of Misery (Ex): As a free action, a miserable lost can
begin a droning song. Every creature within 30 feet who
can hear it is fascinated for as long as the song continues,
plus 1 round thereafter (Will negates). The mere sight of
the lost does not allow a new saving throw, but any attack
made against an affected character-even if the attack
comes from the lost itself-automatically ends the effect.
Song of misery is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
All lost are immune to the emotion-based special attacks
of other lost, even if they don't share the same emotion.
Special Qualities: A lost has all the special qualities of
the base creature, plus the following special qualities.
Damage Reduction (Su): A lost has damage reduction equal to
one-half its character level (rounded up) that can be bypassed
by magic weapons (maximum 10/magic at character level 20).
A lost's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Twisted Mind (Ex): A lost's mind is demented and difficult
to control. If the creature fails its saving throw against a
mind-affecting spell or effect, it can attempt to save again 1
round later at the same DC. The lost gets only this one extra
chance to succeed on its saving throw.
Abilities: Alter from the base creature as follows: Str +4,
Con +4, Int -6 (minimum 1). If the lost's Intelligence score
falls to 2 or 1, the creature regresses to an animal state and
commences living off the wild as best it can.
Organization: Any.
Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1.
Alignment: Always evil (any).

A midnight construct's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Essentia Modifications (Su): When a spellcaster creates a midnight construct by means of one of the conjure midnight construct spells, she can grant it one or more of the following modifications by investing essentia in it. Some of these powers can be given to any midnight construct; others can be given only to standard or greater midnight constructs, as indicated in parentheses after the ability name. Midnight constructs that spontaneously manifest do not gain these benefits.
Combat Power (Any): The midnight construct gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls per point of essentia invested.
#186
Damage Reduction (Any): The midnight construct's damage reduction value increases by 2 per point of essentia invested.
Deadly Aura (Standard and Greater Only): Every living creature adjacent to the midnight construct at the end of its turn takes 1d6 points of damage per point of essentia invested (Fort DC 10 + 1/2 construct's HD + essentia invested halves).

Skills: *In areas of darkness or shadowy illumination, a midnight construct gains a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks.

#188
CREATING A NECROCARNUM
ZOMBIE
"Necrocarnum zombie" is an acquired template that can be
added to any corporeal creature (except an undead) that has a
skeletal system (referred to hereafter as the base creature).
A necrocarnum zombie uses all the base creature's statistics
and abilities except as noted here.
Size and Type: The creature's type changes to undead,
and it gains the evil and incarnum subtypes. It retains any
other subtypes the base creature had except alignment subtypes
(such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such
as goblinoid or reptilian). It does not gain any augmented
subtype. The creature's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves,
and skill points change as given below. Size is unchanged.
A necrocarnum zombie uses all the base creature's statistics
and special abilities except as noted here.
Hit Dice: All Hit Dice from class levels are dropped, and
each of the creature's remaining Hit Dice increases to a d12.
If the creature has no Hit Dice remaining, it gains 1d12.
Armor Class: The base creature's natural armor bonus
increases by a value based on the zombie's size, as given in
the following table.
Size Natural Armor Bonus Increase
Tiny or smaller +0
Small +1
Medium +2
Large +3
Huge +4
Gargantuan +7
Colossal +11
Base Attack Bonus: A necrocarnum zombie has a base
attack bonus equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice (as a cleric).
Attacks: A necrocarnum zombie loses any weapon
proficiencies that the base creature possessed. It retains
all the natural attacks of the base creature, and it also gains
a slam attack if it didn't already have one. A necrocarnum
zombie's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as magic and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction. A necrocarnum zombie
fighting without weapons uses either its slam attack or
its primary natural weapon (if it has any). A necrocarnum
zombie armed with a weapon uses its slam or a weapon,
as it desires.
Full Attack: A necrocarnum zombie fighting without
weapons uses either its slam attack (see above) or its natural
weapons (if it has any). If armed with a weapon, it uses
the weapon as its primary attack along with a slam or other
natural weapon as a natural secondary attack.
Damage: Necrocarnum zombies have slam attacks. If
the base creature does not have this attack form, use the
appropriate damage value from the table below according to
the necrocarnum zombie's size. If the base creature already
had a slam attack, it retains its old damage value or uses the
appropriate value from the table below, whichever is better.

special qualities.
Damage Reduction: A necrocarnum zombie gains damage
reduction 5/magic and slashing.
Essentia Pool: A necrocarnum zombie has a number of
essentia points equal to 1 + 1 per 6 HD. It can invest this
essentia in its incarnum speed and incarnum defense special
abilities as if they were soulmelds (that is, as a swift action).
Each of its essentia-based abilities has a capacity of 1 + 1 per
6 HD.
Incarnum Defense: A necrocarnum zombie gains an
insight bonus to its AC and on its saving throws. The value
of this bonus equals the points of essentia it has invested
in this ability.
Incarnum Speed: A necrocarnum zombie gains an insight
bonus to all its speeds. The value of this bonus equals +10
feet per point of essentia it has invested in this ability. The
creature also gains an insight bonus equal to twice the points

Darkness emanates from
an indistinct, vaguely
humanoid shape. Its
eyes glow like coals, and
its oversized mouth is filled
with massive teeth. A cold,
dark mist coalesces around the
creature, swirling as if some force
were drawing it inside the body.
Souleaters feed on soul energy, devouring
life in its purest form by consuming
incarnum. These horrific creatures roam the
Gray Wastes searching for living creatures to sate
their unending appetites. Occasionally, a souleater
slips through a planar gateway to spread death wherever
it roams.
A souleater stands 10 feet tall and weighs
nearly 1,000 pounds. It vaguely resembles a
human, except for its glowing eyes and its huge,
toothy maw.
Souleaters do not speak, but they do understand all spoken
languages. In the rare cases when they attempt to communicate
with others, they do so telepathically.

CREATING A SOULFUSED
CONSTRUCT
"Soulfused" is an acquired template that can be added to
any construct that has neither an Intelligence score nor
the living construct subtype (referred to hereafter as the
base creature).
A soulfused construct uses all the base creature's statistics
and abilities except as noted here.
Size and Type: A soulfused construct's type does not
change, but it gains the living construct subtype (see Living
Construct sidebar). Size is unchanged.
Hit Dice: The soulfused construct retains the base
creature's Hit Dice and hit points (but see Advancing a
Soulspark, page 198).
Special Qualities: A soulfused construct has all the special
qualities of the base creature except its construct traits,
which it loses. It gains the living construct traits detailed in
the sidebar, as well as the following special qualities.
Essentia Pool: The incarnum possessing the soulfused
construct's form gives it an essentia pool equal to 1 + 1 per
6 HD it possesses.
Soulbound Resistance: A soulfused construct can invest its
essentia in this special quality as if it were a soulmeld. Every
point of invested essentia grants it a +1 resistance bonus
on all saving throws. The maximum essentia capacity of
this quality is as normal for a character of the construct's
character level.
Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Dex
+2, Cha +4. The soulfused construct also gains an Intelligence
score of 3 and a Constitution score of 10.
Skills: The soulfused construct gains skill ranks equal
to its HD + 3. All skills except Speak Language are considered
cross-class. Most soulfused constructs spend the
majority of their skill points on Listen or Spot, and any odd point that might be left over to learn Common or some
other language.
Feats: The soulfused construct gains feats at the rate of
1 + 1/ 3 HD, just as a normal creature does. Common feats
selected by such creatures include Improved Initiative,
Improved Natural Attack, Iron Will, and Power Attack.
Organization: Solitary.
Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1.
Alignment: Usually chaotic (any). The fusion of incarnum
and construct rarely produces a disciplined or orderly
mindset.
Advancement: By character class.
Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature +1.
