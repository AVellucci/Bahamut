Acid (Ex): A dissolution ooze secretes a digestive
acid that dissolves all materials except earth and stone
(including gemstones and crystals). Any melee hit from
the creature deals 1d6 points of acid damage in addition to
normal damage.
Dissolution (Ex): Any melee hit by a dissolution ooze
against a creature with at least one soulmeld shaped
requires the target to attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save.
Failure indicates that one of the target's soulmelds
(determined randomly) spontaneously unshapes. If the
dissolution ooze successfully unshapes a soulmeld, it
immediately consumes the freed soul energy, gaining
a number of temporary hit points equal to 5 times the
points of essentia invested in the soulmeld (minimum
5 hp). The target loses all benefits of the meld until it is
shaped again.
A successful save negates this effect. The target gains a
+4 bonus on the saving throw if the soulmeld is bound to
a chakra. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Incarnum Sense (Ex): A dissolution ooze can detect
the presence of incarnum in creatures or objects within
range of its blindsight. In addition to soulmelds, this ability
detects any creature with the incarnum subtype, as well as
objects invested with essentia. The dissolution ooze can't differentiate
between targets upon which it can "feed" (namely
soulmelds) and other incarnum-laced targets. However, if it
fails to unshape a soulmeld with its first hit, it moves on to a
different target, if one is available.

Breath Weapon (Su): An incarnum
dragon's breath weapon is a cone of resonating
energy that separates incarnum
from living matter and deals damage
to creatures (but not to objects). Every
creature within the area must make a
Reflex save or be temporarily
drained of essentia. This
effect reduces the essentia
pool of each target
by a number of points
equal to the dragon's
age category for 1 hour.
A successful Fortitude
save halves both the
damage dealt and the essentia
drained. The save DC
is Constitution-based.
Meldshaping Ability: An incarnum
dragon has the innate ability
to shape soulmelds chosen from the soulborn
class list. Each day, it can shape a number of
soulmelds equal to one-half its age category
(rounded up). Its meldshaper level equals twice
its age category, and the maximum essentia capacity
of its soulmelds is one-half its age category
(rounded down). The incarnum dragon's essentia
pool increases with its age, as given on the Incarnum Dragon
Abilities by Age Table on page 174.
Chakra Binds: Beginning at juvenile age, an incarnum
dragon can bind a single soulmeld to its crown chakra. An
old incarnum dragon can bind up to two soulmelds simultaneously,
one each to its brow and crown chakras. A great
wyrm incarnum dragon can bind up to three soulmelds, one
each to its brow, crown, and throat chakras.
Consume Soulmeld (Su): With a successful bite attack,
an ancient or older incarnum dragon can consume a
single soulmeld shaped on the target creature. In addition
to dealing normal damage, this attack requires the
creature to make a Fortitude save at the same DC as the
dragon's breath weapon. Failure indicates that one of the
target's soulmelds (determined randomly) spontaneously
unshapes. The dragon then consumes the soul energy
from the meld, gaining a number of temporary hit points
equal to 5 times the points of essentia invested in the
meld (minimum 5 hp). The target loses all benefits of
the meld until it is shaped again. Once it has consumed
a soulmeld, the incarnum dragon cannot use this ability
again for 24 hours.
Skills: Spellcraft is a class skill for incarnum dragons. Furthermore, because of its constant contact with the
souls of the past, present, and future, an incarnum dragon
gains an insight bonus equal to its age category on all
Knowledge checks.

Rage (Ex): Once per day, a totem giant can enter a state
of fierce rage that lasts for 9 rounds. The following changes
are in effect as long as he rages: hp increase by 26; AC
21, touch 8, flat-footed 20; Grp +21; Atk +16 melee (2d8+15,
greatclub) or +16 melee (1d4+11, slam) or +9 ranged (2d8+8,

Fort +14, Will +17; Str 27, Con 23; Climb +15. At
the end of his rage, the totem giant is fatigued
for the duration of the encounter. The Cobalt
Rage feat grants him +1 insight bonus
on melee damage rolls and Will
saves while he rages. The 2 points of
essentia that he typically has invested
in his Cobalt Rage feat grant
him an additional +2 insight bonus
on weapon damage rolls and
Will saves while he rages (included
in the statistics above).
Rock Throwing (Ex): The
range increment for a totem
giant's thrown rocks is 120 feet.
He uses both hands when throwing
a rock.
Soulmelds (Su): A totem giant
can shape two soulmelds, drawn
from the totemist list. He currently
has the following soulmelds
shaped. Each of these soulmelds
has an essentia capacity of 3 (or
4 if bound to his totem chakra).
The sample totem giant currently
has the following soulmelds
shaped and bound.
Frost Helm (Su): A totem
giant gains a +5 bonus on Balance
checks made on ice and
resistance to cold 10. Because
this soulmeld is bound to his
totem chakra, he also gains a trill attack
that stuns three creatures within 20 feet for 1d4 rounds (Will
negates, DC 16).
Great Raptor Mask (Su): A totem giant gains a +6 competence
bonus on Spot checks.
#179
Essentia Pool: A totem giant has an essentia pool of 6
(including +2 for the Bonus Essentia feat and +1 for the Cobalt
Rage feat) and an essentia capacity of 3 (or 4 for any soulmeld
bound to his totem chakra). He typically invests 2 points in
his Cobalt Rage feat, 2 points in his frost helm, and 2 points
in his great raptor mask.
Rock Catching (Ex): A totem giant gains a +4 racial
bonus on his Ref lex save when attempting to catch a
thrown rock.
Totem Chakra Bind (Su): A totem giant can bind one
of his soulmelds to his totem chakra, gaining the benefits
thereof. The sample totem giant has bound his frost helm to
his totem chakra.

Adaptive Attack (Ex): When it strikes, an incarnum
golem adapts its attack to take advantage of weaknesses in
the opponent's defenses. Each round that it successfully damages
a living creature, it gains a cumulative +1 insight bonus
(maximum +5) on attack rolls and damage rolls against that
opponent. This bonus remains in force until the golem deals
damage to a different living creature. For example, the first
time an incarnum golem damages a living foe, a +1 bonus
applies to each of its attacks against that target in subsequent
rounds. The next time it hits that foe, the bonus increases to
+2. During any round that it misses the target, the bonus does
not increase. If the incarnum golem hits a different target
at any point in that progression, the bonus against the first
target is lost, and a new bonus begins to accrue against the
new target.
Immunity to Magic (Ex): An incarnum golem is immune
to the effect of any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell
resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
differently against the creature, as noted below.
A dispel evil, dispel good, dispel chaos, dispel law, or dismissal
spell resets an incarnum golem's adaptive attack bonus to
+0 and dazes the creature for 1 round. A banishment spell
also resets an incarnum golem's adaptive attack bonus
but dazes the golem for 1d4+1 rounds. While the golem
is dazed by either of these effects, its fast healing ability
is suppressed.

Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid that has an essentia
pool and is slain by an incarnum wraith becomes a new
incarnum wraith in 1d4 rounds. Its body remains intact
and inanimate, but its spirit is torn free from its corpse and
transformed. Such spawn are under the command of the
incarnum wraith that created them and remain enslaved
until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they
had in life.
A humanoid that does not have an essentia pool is merely
dead if slain by an incarnum wraith. It does not become a
new incarnum wraith.
Essentia Drain (Su): Any living creature hit by an incarnum
wraith's incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a DC
19 Fortitude save or lose 1d4 points of essentia. The save DC
is Charisma-based.
If the creature struck does not have essentia, or its essentia
pool is already depleted, it takes Constitution damage equal
to the points of essentia that would normally be lost.
Whether it drains essentia or Constitution, an incarnum
wraith gains 5 temporary hit points on each successful attack.
Lost essentia returns to the character's essentia pool when the
wraith is destroyed, or 1 hour after the loss occurs, whichever
comes first.

#183 TEMPLATE
CREATING A LOST
"Lost" is an acquired template that can be added to any living
creature with an Intelligence score of at least 3 (referred to
hereafter as the base creature).
A lost uses all the base creature's statistics and abilities
except as noted here.
Size and Type: A lost's type does not change, but it gains
the incarnum subtype. Size is unchanged.
Speed: The creature's base land speed increases by 10 ft.
Though a lost might stumble and twitch, it can be surprisingly
nimble when closing for a kill. Any swim, fly, or burrow
speeds the base creature might have do not increase.
Armor Class: The base creature's natural armor bonus
improves by 3.
Attack: A lost retains all the attacks of the base creature
and also gains a slam attack if it didn't already have one.
If the base creature can use weapons, the lost retains this
ability. A creature with natural weapons retains those
natural weapons. A lost fighting without weapons uses
either its slam attack or its primary natural weapon (if it
has any). A lost armed with a weapon uses its slam or a
weapon, as it desires.
Full Attack: A lost fighting without weapons uses either
its slam attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has any).
If armed with a weapon, it uses the weapon as its primary
attack along with a slam or other natural weapon as a natural
secondary attack.
Damage: Losts have slam attacks. If the base creature does
not have this attack form, use the appropriate damage value
from the table below according to the lost's size. If the base
creature already had a slam attack, it retains its old damage
value or uses the appropriate value from the table below,
whichever is better. A lost's natural weapon attacks deal the
same base damage as the corresponding attacks of the base
creature did.
Size Base Slam Damage
Up to Tiny 1
Small 1d3
Medium 1d4
Large 1d6
Huge 1d8
Gargantuan 2d6
Colossal 2d8
Special Attacks: A lost has all the special attacks of the
base creature, except for any spells that it can no longer
cast because of its reduced Intelligence score. In addition,
it gains a new special attack based on the particular
emotion that has been fused to its soul, as given on the
following table.
Emotion Special Attack
Despair Mirror of despair
Hatred Bile of hatred
Misery Song of misery
Wrath Fury of wrath
Bile of Hatred (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a hateful lost
can spew acidic bile in a 30-foot cone as a standard action.
Every creature in the area takes 1d4 points of acid damage
per character level of the lost. A successful Reflex save halves
this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Fury of Wrath (Ex): A wrathful lost automatically enters
a ragelike state on its first turn in combat. While in this
state, it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to
twice its character level and a bonus on damage rolls equal
to one-half its character level (rounded up). Its fury lasts
for 10 rounds.
Mirror of Despair (Ex): The gaze of a despairing lost is unsettling
to sentient creatures. Any creature with an Intelligence
score of 3 or higher that is within 30 feet of the lost and can
see it must make a Will save or become shaken for 2d6 rounds.
Success indicates that the creature cannot be affected again
by the same lost's mirror of despair for 24 hours. Mirror
of despair is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
Song of Misery (Ex): As a free action, a miserable lost can
begin a droning song. Every creature within 30 feet who
can hear it is fascinated for as long as the song continues,
plus 1 round thereafter (Will negates). The mere sight of
the lost does not allow a new saving throw, but any attack
made against an affected character-even if the attack
comes from the lost itself-automatically ends the effect.
Song of misery is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
All lost are immune to the emotion-based special attacks
of other lost, even if they don't share the same emotion.
Special Qualities: A lost has all the special qualities of
the base creature, plus the following special qualities.
Damage Reduction (Su): A lost has damage reduction equal to
one-half its character level (rounded up) that can be bypassed
by magic weapons (maximum 10/magic at character level 20).
A lost's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Twisted Mind (Ex): A lost's mind is demented and difficult
to control. If the creature fails its saving throw against a
mind-affecting spell or effect, it can attempt to save again 1
round later at the same DC. The lost gets only this one extra
chance to succeed on its saving throw.
Abilities: Alter from the base creature as follows: Str +4,
Con +4, Int -6 (minimum 1). If the lost's Intelligence score
falls to 2 or 1, the creature regresses to an animal state and
commences living off the wild as best it can.
Organization: Any.
Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1.
Alignment: Always evil (any).

A midnight construct's natural weapons are treated as
magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
Essentia Modifications (Su): When a spellcaster creates
a midnight construct by means of one of the conjure midnight
construct spells, she can grant it one or more of the following
modifications by investing essentia in it. Some of these
powers can be given to any midnight construct; others can
be given only to standard or greater midnight constructs, as
indicated in parentheses after the ability name. Midnight
constructs that spontaneously manifest do not gain these
benefits.
Combat Power (Any): The midnight construct gains a +1
enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls per
point of essentia invested.
#186
Damage Reduction (Any): The midnight construct's
damage reduction value increases by 2 per point of essentia
invested.
Deadly Aura (Standard and Greater Only): Every living creature
adjacent to the midnight construct at the end of its turn
takes 1d6 points of damage per point of essentia invested (Fort
DC 10 + 1/2 construct's HD + essentia invested halves).
Fly Speed (Standard and Greater Only): The midnight construct
gains a fly speed of 20 feet per point of essentia invested
(perfect maneuverability).
Land Speed Increase (Any): The midnight construct's land
speed increases by 10 feet per point of essentia invested.
Teleportation (Greater Only): As a move action, the midnight
construct can teleport up to 20 feet per point of
essentia invested.
Soulburning Aura (Greater Only): Every living creature
adjacent to the midnight construct at the end of its turn
takes 1 point of Strength damage per point of essentia
invested (Will negates, DC 10 + 1/2 construct's HD +
essentia invested).
Construct Traits: A midnight construct has immunity
to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,
necromancy effects, mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions,
phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any
effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works
on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to extra damage
from critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability
drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal
damage, but it can be repaired.
Skills: *In areas of darkness or shadowy illumination,
a midnight construct gains a +10 racial bonus on Hide
checks.

CREATING A NECROCARNUM
ZOMBIE
"Necrocarnum zombie" is an acquired template that can be
added to any corporeal creature (except an undead) that has a
skeletal system (referred to hereafter as the base creature).
A necrocarnum zombie uses all the base creature's statistics
and abilities except as noted here.
Size and Type: The creature's type changes to undead,
and it gains the evil and incarnum subtypes. It retains any
other subtypes the base creature had except alignment subtypes
(such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such
as goblinoid or reptilian). It does not gain any augmented
subtype. The creature's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves,
and skill points change as given below. Size is unchanged.
A necrocarnum zombie uses all the base creature's statistics
and special abilities except as noted here.
Hit Dice: All Hit Dice from class levels are dropped, and
each of the creature's remaining Hit Dice increases to a d12.
If the creature has no Hit Dice remaining, it gains 1d12.
Armor Class: The base creature's natural armor bonus
increases by a value based on the zombie's size, as given in
the following table.
Size Natural Armor Bonus Increase
Tiny or smaller +0
Small +1
Medium +2
Large +3
Huge +4
Gargantuan +7
Colossal +11
Base Attack Bonus: A necrocarnum zombie has a base
attack bonus equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice (as a cleric).
Attacks: A necrocarnum zombie loses any weapon
proficiencies that the base creature possessed. It retains
all the natural attacks of the base creature, and it also gains
a slam attack if it didn't already have one. A necrocarnum
zombie's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
are treated as magic and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction. A necrocarnum zombie
fighting without weapons uses either its slam attack or
its primary natural weapon (if it has any). A necrocarnum
zombie armed with a weapon uses its slam or a weapon,
as it desires.
Full Attack: A necrocarnum zombie fighting without
weapons uses either its slam attack (see above) or its natural
weapons (if it has any). If armed with a weapon, it uses
the weapon as its primary attack along with a slam or other
natural weapon as a natural secondary attack.
Damage: Necrocarnum zombies have slam attacks. If
the base creature does not have this attack form, use the
appropriate damage value from the table below according to
the necrocarnum zombie's size. If the base creature already
had a slam attack, it retains its old damage value or uses the
appropriate value from the table below, whichever is better.
A necrocarnum zombie's natural weapon attacks deal the
same base damage as the corresponding attacks of the base
creature did.

Fine 1
Diminutive 1d2
Tiny 1d3
Small 1d4
Medium 1d6

Special Attacks: A necrocarnum zombie loses all the
special attacks of the base creature.
Special Qualities: A necrocarnum zombie loses all the
special qualities of the base creature, and it gains the following
special qualities.
Damage Reduction: A necrocarnum zombie gains damage
reduction 5/magic and slashing.
Essentia Pool: A necrocarnum zombie has a number of
essentia points equal to 1 + 1 per 6 HD. It can invest this
essentia in its incarnum speed and incarnum defense special
abilities as if they were soulmelds (that is, as a swift action).
Each of its essentia-based abilities has a capacity of 1 + 1 per
6 HD.
Incarnum Defense: A necrocarnum zombie gains an
insight bonus to its AC and on its saving throws. The value
of this bonus equals the points of essentia it has invested
in this ability.
Incarnum Speed: A necrocarnum zombie gains an insight
bonus to all its speeds. The value of this bonus equals +10
feet per point of essentia it has invested in this ability. The
creature also gains an insight bonus equal to twice the points
of invested essentia on its initiative checks.
Saves: The necrocarnum zombie's base save bonuses
are as follows: Fort + 1/3 HD, Ref +1/2 HD +2, and Will

Darkness emanates from
an indistinct, vaguely
humanoid shape. Its
eyes glow like coals, and
its oversized mouth is filled
with massive teeth. A cold,
dark mist coalesces around the
creature, swirling as if some force
were drawing it inside the body.
Souleaters feed on soul energy, devouring
life in its purest form by consuming
incarnum. These horrific creatures roam the
Gray Wastes searching for living creatures to sate
their unending appetites. Occasionally, a souleater
slips through a planar gateway to spread death wherever
it roams.
A souleater stands 10 feet tall and weighs
nearly 1,000 pounds. It vaguely resembles a
human, except for its glowing eyes and its huge,
toothy maw.
Souleaters do not speak, but they do understand all spoken
languages. In the rare cases when they attempt to communicate
with others, they do so telepathically.

Consume Soul (Su): A souleater automatically draws
in the soul energy of all creatures that die within 30 feet
of it. From each soul captured in this manner, it gains +10
hp and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and saving throws.
These bonuses fade after a period of 10 minutes
per character level of the creature that died.
At the end of this period, the soul has
been entirely consumed.
A creature whose soul has been
trapped by a souleater cannot be
raised from the dead until the
souleater is slain. If the souleater
manages to consume
the soul entirely, the creature
can be returned to
life only by a miracle, true
resurrection, or wish.
Soulless Aura (Su):
A souleater emanates a
misty aura of negative
energy, which drains
away the essence of nearby
souls. Each living
creature within 30 feet
of a souleater gains a negative
level, which persists
as long as the souleater remains
within that range.
This negative level never
results in actual level loss.
A soul eater does not gain
extra hit points from the negative
levels that this aura bestows
on other creatures, but it does gain
a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls
and damage rolls as long as at least
one living creature (other than another
souleater) is within this aura.
The soulless aura also makes the manipulation
of incarnum more difficult. Any character
within 30 feet of a souleater who attempts to shape
a soulmeld, bind a soulmeld or magic item to a
chakra, or invest or reallocate essentia must succeed
on a DC 20 Concentration check to do so.
Souleaters are immune to the soulless auras
of other souleaters.
Telepathy (Su): A souleater can communicate
telepathically with any creature within 100
Souleater feet that has a language.
#195
Vulnerability to Turning (Ex): If a souleater is subjected
to a turn undead attempt, it must succeed on a Fortitude
saving throw (DC 10 + character's effective turning level) or
be dazed for 1 round.

#196
CREATING A SOULFUSED
CONSTRUCT
"Soulfused" is an acquired template that can be added to
any construct that has neither an Intelligence score nor
the living construct subtype (referred to hereafter as the
base creature).
A soulfused construct uses all the base creature's statistics
and abilities except as noted here.
Size and Type: A soulfused construct's type does not
change, but it gains the living construct subtype (see Living
Construct sidebar). Size is unchanged.
Hit Dice: The soulfused construct retains the base
creature's Hit Dice and hit points (but see Advancing a
Soulspark, page 198).
Special Qualities: A soulfused construct has all the special
qualities of the base creature except its construct traits,
which it loses. It gains the living construct traits detailed in
the sidebar, as well as the following special qualities.
Essentia Pool: The incarnum possessing the soulfused
construct's form gives it an essentia pool equal to 1 + 1 per
6 HD it possesses.
Soulbound Resistance: A soulfused construct can invest its
essentia in this special quality as if it were a soulmeld. Every
point of invested essentia grants it a +1 resistance bonus
on all saving throws. The maximum essentia capacity of
this quality is as normal for a character of the construct's
character level.
Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Dex
+2, Cha +4. The soulfused construct also gains an Intelligence
score of 3 and a Constitution score of 10.
Skills: The soulfused construct gains skill ranks equal
to its HD + 3. All skills except Speak Language are considered
cross-class. Most soulfused constructs spend the
majority of their skill points on Listen or Spot, and any odd point that might be left over to learn Common or some
other language.
Feats: The soulfused construct gains feats at the rate of
1 + 1/ 3 HD, just as a normal creature does. Common feats
selected by such creatures include Improved Initiative,
Improved Natural Attack, Iron Will, and Power Attack.
Organization: Solitary.
Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1.
Alignment: Usually chaotic (any). The fusion of incarnum
and construct rarely produces a disciplined or orderly
mindset.
Advancement: By character class.
Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature +1.

*Alignment Subtype: A soulspark's alignment subtype
matches its nonneutral alignment component.
Amorphous (Ex): A soulspark is not subject to critical
hits. Creatures that flank it gain none of the normal benefits
of flanking.
**Damage Reduction (Su): A soulspark has damage
reduction of a type opposed to its nonneutral alignment. For
example, a chaotic neutral soulspark has DR 5/lawful, and a
neutral evil soulspark has DR 5/good.
Incarnum Shroud (Su): A soulspark manifested naturally
can manipulate the soul energy surrounding its form and
use it for a variety of purposes. This ability gives the creature
an essentia pool equal to its HD. It can invest or
reallocate this essentia into the following
special abilities as a swift action,
as if the abilities were soulmelds.
Each ability has an essentia
capacity equal to one-half the
soulspark's HD.
Offense: A soulspark gains
a +1 insight bonus on attack
rolls and damage rolls for every
point of essentia invested.
Defense: A soulspark gains
a +1 insight bonus to AC and
on saving throws for every
point of essentia invested.
Healing: A soulspark gains
fast healing at a rate equal to
twice the number of essentia
points invested.
A soulspark created by
means of the soulspark familiar
soulmeld does not have
this ability. Instead, it relies
upon essentia provided by
its shaper.
Soul Blast (Su): A soulspark
attacks by focusing soul energy on its
target as a ranged attack with a range of 5 feet. It
gains a bonus on its damage roll equal to its Charisma bonus
(if any). This doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
