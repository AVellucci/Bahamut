Race Traits ~ Rilkan							CATEGORY:Internal																																																																																																																																									ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=RilkanRaceTrait

Racial Knowledge		KEY:Rilkan ~ Racial Knowledge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.RilkanRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:The rilkan race is linked through the power of incarnum to the accumulated knowledge of their entire people. This manifests in two ways. First, all Knowledge checks are treated as trained skill checks for rilkans, regardless of whether they actually have ranks in the skill. Even without formal instruction, a rilkan naturally absorbs learning from the accumulated knowledge of her people. Second, rilkans gain a competence bonus on all Knowledge checks and bardic knowledge checks. This bonus is +1, but increases by an additional +1 for every two soulmelds currently shaped by the rilkan, since each soulmeld contains a small portion of the collected souls of the rilkan race.																							SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Racial Skill		KEY:Rilkan ~ Racial Skill		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.RilkanRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:+2 racial bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks: Rilkans are talented at saying the right word at the right time.																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Racial Aid			KEY:Rilkan ~ Racial Aid			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.RilkanRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:Because of the incarnum bond that knits together all rilkans, at any time that a rilkan succeeds in using the aid another action to assist another rilkan, she adds +3 to the ally's roll, rather than +2.																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.12

Race Traits ~ Skarn							CATEGORY:Internal																																																																																																																																									ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=SkarnRaceTrait
Natural Weapon (Spines)	KEY:Skarn ~ Natural Weapon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.SkarnRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:A skarn can make one attack with his arm spines each round, either with his primary hand or with his off-hand (taking the normal penalties for fi ghting with an off-hand weapon). This attack deals 1d6 points of piercing damage; if it is used as an off-hand weapon, the skarn may add only one-half his Strength bonus to the damage roll. A skarn can't attack with his spines and a weapon wielded by the same arm in the same round. If a skarn makes a spine attack with an arm carrying a shield, he loses the shield's bonus to AC until the start of his next turn. If the skarn has a soulmeld bound to his arms chakra, his spine attacks are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. See Chakra Binds, page 51, for details.											SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Racial Skill		KEY:Skarn ~ Racial Skill		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceTrait.SkarnRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:+2 racial bonus on Intimidate and Climb checks: Skarns learn quickly how to use their spines to create a display of ferocity. These same spines aid skarns when they climb.																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.15

ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=WeaponProfSimple|TYPE=ArmorProfMedium|TYPE=ShieldProf	SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Meldshaping				KEY:Incarnate ~ Meldshaping				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.IncarnateClassFeature.SpecialQuality			DESC:An incarnate's primary ability is shaping incarnum soulmelds, which are drawn from the incarnate soulmeld list (page 54). You know and can shape any soulmeld from this list (but see Aligned Soulmelds, below). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an incarnate soulmeld is 10 + number of points of essentia invested in the soulmeld + your Wisdom modifier. Your meldshaper level is equal to your incarnate level. An incarnate can shape only a certain number of soulmelds per day. Your base daily allotment is given on Table 2-2: The Incarnate. The maximum number of soulmelds that you can have shaped simultaneously is equal to your Constitution score minus 10 or the number of soulmelds allowed for your level, whichever is lower. At 1st level, you can shape two soulmelds at a time (assuming you have a Constitution score of at least 12). As you advance in level, you can shape an increasing number of soulmelds. At 1st level, you also gain access to your personal pool of essentia, which can be invested into your soulmelds to increase their power. Your essentia pool's size is shown on Table 2-2: The Incarnate. Your character level, as noted on Table 2-1: Essentia Capacity, determines the maximum quantity of essentia that you can invest in any single soulmeld. As a swift action, you can reallocate your essentia investments in your soulmelds every round (see Essentia, page 50). An incarnate does not study or prepare soulmelds in advance, but must have a good night's rest and must meditate for 1 hour to shape his soulmelds for the day (see Shaping Soulmelds, page 49).																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Aligned Soulmelds			KEY:Incarnate ~ Aligned Soulmelds			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.IncarnateClassFeature.SpecialQuality			DESC:You cannot shape soulmelds with an alignment descriptor that does not match your own. For example, if you are a good incarnate, you cannot shape soulmelds with the chaotic, lawful, or evil descriptors.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Chakra Binds			KEY:Incarnate ~ Chakra Binds				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.IncarnateClassFeature.SpecialQuality			DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you can bind your soulmelds to your chakras, granting you new powers based on the soulmeld and the chakra chosen. Binding a soulmeld to a chakra closes the body slot associated with that chakra (see Chakras , page 50), so that you cannot also benefit from a magic item worn on the body slot associated with that chakra. The number of chakra binds that you can have active at any one time depends on your level (see the Chakra Binds column on Table 2-2: The Incarnate). At 2nd level, you can bind a soulmeld to your crown chakra. Beginning at 4th level, you can bind soulmelds to your feet or hands chakras. At 9th level, you can bind soulmelds to your arms, brow, or shoulders chakras. At 14th level, you can bind soulmelds to your throat or waist chakras. At 16th level, you can bind a soulmeld to your heart chakra, and at 19th level you can bind a soulmeld to your soul chakra. For more information on chakra binds, see page 51.																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Aura					KEY:Incarnate ~ Aura					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.IncarnateClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:You have a particularly powerful aura corresponding to your alignment (see the detect evil spell). The power of your aura is equal to your incarnate level, just like the aura of a cleric. Similarly, your soulmelds always radiate good, evil, law, or chaos (according to your alignment) as though they were aligned magic items with a caster level equal to your class level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Detect Opposition			KEY:Incarnate ~ Detect Opposition			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.ClassFeature.IncarnateClassFeature.SpecialQuality		DESC:At will, you can attempt to detect the presence of creatures whose alignment is opposite your own. This ability works like the detect evil spell, except that it detects the specific alignment opposed to your own. For example, a good incarnate can detect evil, while a chaotic incarnate can detect law.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Expanded Soulmeld Capacity	KEY:Incarnate ~ Expanded Soulmeld Capacity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.IncarnateClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Incarnates are specially gifted in their ability to invest essentia into soulmelds. At 3rd level and again at 15th level, the essentia capacity of your soulmelds increases by 1, superseding the number on Table 2-1. This only applies to soulmelds, not to feats, class features, or other abilities that allow essentia investment.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Incarnum Radiance			KEY:Incarnate ~ Incarnum Radiance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.IncarnateClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As an incarnate, you fuse incarnum with your very soul. You can tap into your incarnum-fused soul to activate a visible radiant aura of power, granting you an increase in a particular area of prowess. You can activate this ability as a free action once per day at 3rd level, twice per day at 8th level, and one additional time per day for every five levels gained thereafter (3/day at 13th level and 4/day at 18th). This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round).	DESC:&nl;Good: Your body shines with silvery light. You gain a +1 bonus to AC; this bonus improves by 1 for every five levels gained (+2 at 5th level, +3 at 10th, +4 at 15th, and +5 at 20th level).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Incarnate Alignment Focus(Good)	DESC:&nl;Evil: An ash-gray aura surrounds you. You gain a +2 bonus on melee damage rolls; this bonus improves by 2 for every five levels gained (+4 at 5th level, +6 at 10th, +8 at 15th, and +10 at 20th level).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Incarnate Alignment Focus(Evil)																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.22	DESC:&nl;Lawful: You glow with a blood-red corona. You gain a +1 bonus on melee attack rolls; this bonus improves by 1 for every five levels gained (+2 at 5th level, +3 at 10th, +4 at 15th, and +5 at 20th level).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Incarnate Alignment Focus(Lawful)																										DESC:&nl;Chaotic: A faint green nimbus surrounds your body. You gain a 10-foot increase to your base land speed. This is considered a bonus. This increase improves by 10 feet for every five levels gained (+20 at 5th level, +30 at 10th, +40 at 15th, and +50 at 20th level).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Incarnate Alignment Focus(Chaotic)
Rapid Meldshaping			KEY:Incarnate ~ Rapid Meldshaping			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.IncarnateClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As your ability to channel incarnum into soulmelds increases, you learn to shape a small number of soulmelds instantly. Starting at 5th level, once per day you can unshape one of your existing soulmelds and immediately shape another soulmeld. This process requires a full-round action and provokes attacks of opportunity. The soulmeld that you shape cannot be bound to a chakra, even if the soulmeld that you unshape was bound to a chakra. You can use this ability twice per day at 11th level and three times per day at 17th.																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Share Incarnum Radiance		KEY:Incarnate ~ Share Incarnum Radiance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.IncarnateClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As you gain control over your powers of incarnum, you learn to share the effect of your incarnum radiance with nearby allies who share at least some of your morals or ethics. Beginning at 7th level, when you activate your incarnum radiance (see above) you can choose for its benefit to also affect all allies within 30 feet of you. Any ally who moves more than 30 feet from you loses the benefit until he returns within range. If you share your incarnum radiance with allies in this fashion, you become fatigued at the end of the power's duration (this fatigue fades in 10 minutes). You must make this choice at the time the radiance is activated. Allies who do not share your alignment cause cannot gain the benefit of your incarnum radiance. For example, a good incarnate's incarnum radiance benefit cannot be shared with allies who are not good. Beginning at 17th level, sharing your incarnum radiance with allies does not fatigue you.																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Perfect Meldshaper		KEY:Incarnate ~ Perfect Meldshaper			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.IncarnateClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 20th level, you gain the ability to flood your body with incarnum for a brief period of time. As a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, you can increase the amount of essentia invested in each of the incarnate soulmelds that you currently have shaped to the maximum essentia capacity of that soulmeld. This total will be greater than the amount of essentia normally available to you. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. During this duration, you can't reallocate essentia from your incarnate soulmelds. You can use this ability once per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.22
True Incarnation			KEY:Incarnate ~ True Incarnation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.IncarnateClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:When you reach 20th level, the process of merging incarnum with your flesh is complete, and you are transformed into a new type of creature. You gain the outsider type, as well as the alignment subtype corresponding to your incarnate cause. Both your natural and weapon attacks are henceforth treated as having the alignment of that subtype for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

SOURCEPAGE:p.25
Smite Opposition			KEY:Soulborn ~ Smite Opposition			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.SoulbornClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Once per day you can channel the power of your incarnum-fueled convictions to attempt to smite a foe with a melee attack. You add your Charisma bonus (if any) to your attack roll and deal 1 extra point of damage per soulborn level. These bonuses apply only against creatures whose alignment opposes at least one component of yours-a lawful good soulborn smites chaotic and evil foes (any creature whose alignment includes either chaos or evil), while a chaotic good soulborn smites lawful and evil foes. If you accidentally smite a creature of the wrong alignment, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day. At 5th level and every five levels thereafter, you can smite opposition one additional time per day to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.25
Incarnum Defense			KEY:Soulborn ~ Incarnum Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.SoulbornClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Your incarnum-fused soul dramatically affects your body and mind. At 2nd level, this manifests as a visible change in your appearance, as well as a particular immunity. The appearance and effects of this fusion depend on your alignment:	DESC:&nl;Lawful Good: Your eyes become orbs of solid gold in color, with no visible pupil or iris. You gain immunity to fear.|PREALIGN:LG	DESC:&nl;Chaotic Good: Your irises turn emerald green. You gain immunity to paralysis.|PREALIGN:CG	DESC:&nl;Lawful Evil: Your pupils display an unholy red hue. You gain immunity to exhaustion (effects that would cause exhaustion render you fatigued instead).|PREALIGN:LE	DESC:&nl;Chaotic Evil: Your eyes become solid orbs of shadowy blackness, with no visible pupil or iris. You gain immunity to any penalty, damage, or drain to your Strength.|PREALIGN:CE																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.25

SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Meldshaping				KEY:Soulborn ~ Meldshaping				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SoulbornClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a soulborn gains a limited ability to shape soulmelds, which are drawn from the soulborn soulmeld list (page 56). You know and can shape any soulmeld from this list (but see Aligned Soulmelds, below). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a soulborn soulmeld is 10 + number of points of essentia invested in the soulmeld + your Constitution modifier. Your meldshaper level is equal to one-half your soulborn level. A soulborn can shape only a certain number of soulmelds per day. Your base daily allotment is given on Table 2-3: The Soulborn. The maximum number of soulmelds that you can have shaped simultaneously is equal to your Constitution score minus 10 or the number of soulmelds on the table, whichever is lower. At 4th level, you can shape one soulmeld at a time (assuming you have a Constitution score of at least 11). As you advance in level, you can shape an increasing number of soulmelds. At 6th level, you gain access to your personal pool of essentia, which can be invested into your soulmelds to increase their power. Your essentia pool's size is shown on Table 2-3: The Soulborn. Your character level, as noted on Table 2-1: Essentia Capacity, determines the maximum quantity of essentia that you can invest in any single soulmeld. As a swift action, you can reallocate your essentia investments in your soulmelds every round (see Essentia, page 50). A soulborn does not study or prepare soulmelds in advance, but must have a good night's rest and must meditate for 1 hour to shape her soulmelds for the day (see Shaping Soulmelds, page 49).																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Aligned Soulmelds			KEY:Soulborn ~ Aligned Soulmelds			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SoulbornClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:You cannot shape soulmelds with an alignment descriptor that does not match your own. For example, if you are a chaotic good soulborn, you cannot shape soulmelds with the lawful or evil descriptors.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Chakra Binds			KEY:Soulborn ~ Chakra Binds				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SoulbornClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Beginning at 8th level, you can bind your soulmelds to your chakras, granting you new powers based on the soulmeld and the chakra chosen. Binding a soulmeld to a chakra closes the body slot associated with that chakra (see Chakras, page 50), so that you cannot also benefit from a magic item worn on the body slot associated with that chakra. The number of chakra binds that you can have active at any one time depends on your level (see the Chakra Binds column on Table 2-3: The Soulborn). At 8th level, you can bind soulmelds to your crown, feet, or hands chakras. At 14th level, you can bind soulmelds to your arms, brow, and shoulders chakras. At 18th level, you can bind soulmelds to your throat or waist chakras. You never gain the ability to bind a soulmeld to your heart or soul chakras. For more information on chakra binds, see page 51.																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Share Incarnum Defense		KEY:Soulborn ~ Share Incarnum Defense		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.SoulbornClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 9th level, once per day you can share your incarnum defense ability with a single ally, providing that character with the same immunity that you enjoy. This requires you to touch the ally to be affected (a standard action). No component of the ally's alignment may be opposed to yours; for example, a lawful good soulborn can affect creatures of lawful good, neutral good, lawful neutral, or neutral alignment, but cannot share the incarnum defense with a chaotic or evil ally. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You can use this ability one additional time per day for every four levels gained above 9th (2/day at 13th level and 3/day at 17th). You can never use this ability on more than one ally at a time; sharing your incarnum defense with a second ally automatically ends the effect on the first.																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Timeless Body			KEY:Soulborn ~ Timeless Body				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.SoulbornClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Upon attaining 19th level, the presence of incarnum within your body becomes so prevalent that your aging process changes dramatically. You no longer take penalties to your ability scores and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that you have already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, penalties continue to apply, and you still die of old age when your time is up.

ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=WeaponProfSimple|TYPE=ArmorProfLight|TYPE=ShieldProf	SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Meldshaping				KEY:Totemist ~ Meldshaping				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:A totemist's primary ability is shaping incarnum soulmelds, which are drawn from the totemist soulmeld list (page 58). You know and can shape any soulmeld from this list. Unlike the aligned forces of an incarnate's melds, your soulmelds channel the bestial spirits of nature. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a totemist soulmeld is 10 + number of points of essentia invested in the soulmeld + your Constitution modifier. Your meldshaper level is equal to your totemist level. A totemist can shape only a certain number of soulmelds per day. Your base daily allotment is given on Table 2-4: The Totemist. The maximum number of soulmelds that you can have shaped simultaneously is equal to your Constitution score minus 10 or the number of soulmelds on the table, whichever is lower. At 1st level, you can shape two soulmelds at a time (assuming you have a Constitution score of at least 12). As you advance in level, you can shape an increasing number of soulmelds. At 1st level, you also gain access to your personal pool of essentia, which can be invested into your soulmelds to increase their power. Your essentia pool's size is shown on Table 2-4: The Totemist. Your character level, as noted on Table 2-1: Essentia Capacity, determines the maximum quantity of essentia that you can invest in any single soulmeld. As a swift action, you can reallocate your essentia investments in your soulmelds every round (see Essentia, page 50). A totemist does not study or prepare soulmelds in advance, but must have a good night's rest and must meditate for 1 hour to shape his soulmelds for the day (see Shaping Soulmelds, page 49).																									SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Chakra Binds			KEY:Totemist ~ Chakra Binds				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you can bind your soulmelds to your chakras, granting you new powers based on the soulmeld and the chakra chosen. Binding a soulmeld to a chakra closes the body slot associated with that chakra (see Chakras, page 50), so that you cannot also benefit from a magic item worn on the body slot associated with that chakra. The number of chakra binds that you can have active at any one time depends on your level (see the Chakra Binds column on Table 2-4: The Totemist). At 2nd level, you can bind a soulmeld to your totem chakra (see below). Beginning at 5th level, you can bind soulmelds to your crown, feet, or hands chakras. At 9th level, you can bind soulmelds to your arms, brow, or shoulders chakras. At 14th level, you can bind soulmelds to your throat or waist chakras. At 17th level, you can bind a soulmeld to your heart chakra. You never gain the ability to bind a soulmeld to your soul chakra. For more information on chakra binds, see page 51.																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Totem Chakra Bind			KEY:Totemist ~ Totem Chakra Bind			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 2nd level, you gain access to a unique chakra: the totem chakra. This chakra is not associated with any location on the body, but rather represents your connection to the wild soul energy of nature, embodied in the magical beasts of the world. When you bind a soulmeld to your totem chakra, you take on characteristics of the creature represented by the meld-usually involving a limited physical transformation. Since the totem chakra doesn't match a body location, binding a soulmeld to this chakra doesn't restrict your use of magic items that take up a body location. Any soulmeld bound to your totem chakra has an essentia capacity 1 higher than the normal capacity for your soulmelds. For example, a 2nd-level totemist can invest up to 2 points of essentia in any soulmeld bound to his totem chakra bind (rather than the normal limit of 1 points of essentia). At 15th level, the capacity of any soulmeld bound to your totem chakra increases by an additional point (meaning that a 15th-level totemist could invest up to 5 points of essentia in that soulmeld). At 6th level, the effective meldshaper level of a soulmeld you have bound to your totem chakra is equal to your actual meldshaper level +1. The primary effect of this benefit is to make that soulmeld harder to unshape. At 11th level, you gain the ability to bind a single soulmeld to your totem chakra and to another chakra at the same time. You gain the special benefits of both chakra binds.																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Wild Empathy			KEY:Totemist ~ Wild Empathy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As the druid class ability; see page 35 of the Player's Handbook. You gain a +4 bonus on wild empathy checks made to influence the reactions of magical beasts of the same kind as the beast associated with the soulmeld bound to your totem chakra. Thus, if you have a basilisk mask bound to your totem chakra, you gain the bonus on checks made to influence basilisks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Illiteracy				KEY:Totemist ~ Illiteracy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Like barbarians, totemists do not begin the game knowing how to read and write. You can spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages you are able to speak. If you gain a level in any other class (except barbarian), you automatically gain literacy. A barbarian who gains a totemist level remains illiterate. Any other character who gains a totemist level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Totem's Protection		KEY:Totemist ~ Totem's Protection			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level, you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against the supernatural abilities of magical beasts.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Rebind Totem Soulmeld		KEY:Totemist ~ Rebind Totem Soulmeld		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As your link to your totem chakra strengthens, you learn to shift the ties that bind your soulmelds. Starting at 8th level, once per day you can unbind a soulmeld from your totem chakra and bind a different meld to that chakra, as long as the new meld is one you already have shaped. This requires a full-round action and provokes attacks of opportunity. You can use this ability one additional time for every four levels gained above 8th (2/day at 12th level, 3/day at 16th, and 4/day at 20th).																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Totem Embodiment			KEY:Totemist ~ Totem Embodiment			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.TotemistClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 20th level, you gain the ability to temporarily link your body and soul to your totem chakra. This greatly enhances the power of essentia invested in soulmelds bound to that chakra. For the duration of this ability, your normal essentia capacity of any soulmeld bound to your totem chakra is doubled. Every point of essentia invested in a soulmeld bound to your totem chakra counts as 2 points of essentia. Activating this ability is a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. It can be used once per day and lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Constitution bonus (minimum 1).

###Block: Soulmelds
# Ability Name			Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type							Required Class						Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																Source Page		Aspects																		A shimmering ring of incarnum energy wreathes your head, shedding a pure blue-white light. The light clearly outlines the shapes of creatures and objects it illuminates, enhancing your visual acuity. The light of souls is pure, highlighting the nuances of physical forms. This soulmeld draws upon that power to shed light on the meldshaper's surroundings. You shape incarnum into a circlet that illuminates the area around you. Your diadem of purelight sheds light as a torch, illuminating a 20-foot radius with bright illumination (and out to a 40-foot radius of shadowy illumination). Creatures gain a +2 insight bonus on Spot checks when attempting to see anything within the radius of illumination (including within the shadowy illumination). For the purpose of interacting with darkness spells, the diadem of purelight is treated as a light spell of a level equal to its invested essentia. Essentia																																																																																																																																				You shape incarnum into boots that surround your feet (as well as any other footwear you might have) and reach up almost to your knees. Midnight blue in color, the impulse boots seem to be made of smooth, supple leather. You channel the spirits of rogues and scoundrels, barbarians, and all who think quickly on their feet, forming that elemental quality into boots that help you do the same. Your impulse boots grant you the ability to avoid dangerous effects. While wearing this soulmeld, you gain the uncanny dodge ability (see page 50 of the Player's Handbook). Essentia
Acrobat Boots	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Acrobat Boots				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraFeet			PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:You form incarnum into a pair of light, supple boots that fit over your feet and any other boots you might wear. Small ruffs of blue-white fur crown each boot. While you wear them, you feel light on your feet. It is difficult to resist the temptation to bounce on the balls of your feet when you're standing still. Channeling energy from the most agile and nimble of souls, you claim some measure of that agility for yourself. While wearing acrobat boots, you gain a +2 insight bonus on Balance, Escape Artist, Jump, and Tumble checks. (This soulmeld does not let you attempt Tumble checks untrained.) Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in the acrobat boots increases the bonus by 2. Chakra Bind (Feet) Your acrobat boots join fast to your feet and help to slow you whenever you fall. You can reduce falling damage by 1d6 points per point of essentia invested in the acrobat boots. For example, if you fall 30 feet while 2 points of essentia are invested, you would take only 1d6 points of damage (rather than 3d6 points).

Adamant Pauldrons	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Adamant Pauldrons			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraShoulders			PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:You shape incarnum into blue crystalline plates of shoulder armor. They float slightly above your shoulders, leaving room for clothing and other armor. In battle, these pauldrons seem to draw attacks toward them, steering blows away from your most vital areas. The use of adamant pauldrons carries a stigma in some incarnate circles because of the example of Murthien the Soul-Render. The infamous incarnate is said to have worn adamant pauldrons on which the tormented visages of imprisoned souls were clearly visible, wracked with pain from the necrocarnum energies Murthien wielded. Wise incarnates refuse to allow the corrupted practice of one notable individual to prevent them from employing a highly useful soulmeld, however. Your adamant pauldrons grant you protection from physical attacks. Whenever a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on you, there is a 25%% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. Essentia: You gain damage reduction equal to the number of points of essentia invested in this soulmeld. This damage reduction is bypassed only by attacks of an alignment opposed to that of your incarnate cause (good, evil, chaos, or law). Thus, if you invest 3 points of essentia in your adamant pauldrons and you are a good incarnate, you gain damage reduction 3/evil. Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Your incarnate pauldrons settle over your shoulders, and they seem to be joined by a crystalline lattice of blue energy across your back. Their power to deflect blows away from vital areas is increased. The chance that your adamant pauldrons negate a critical hit or sneak attack against you increases to 50%%.

Airstep Sandals	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Airstep Sandals			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraFeet			PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:You shape incarnum into a pair of sky-blue sandals. They surround your feet without quite touching them, fitting over any boots or shoes you wear. When you use the flight ability of the sandals, you leave a faint trail of blue vapor behind you, which disperses after a few seconds. Many creatures have the gift of flight, and with this soulmeld, you channel soul energy derived from such creatures to borrow that gift. The rilkan incarnate Davi the Trickster was rarely seen without this soulmeld shaped, and she claimed that she could communicate with the djinn whose soul energy she borrowed to form it. While worn, the airstep sandals allow you to fly up to 10 feet (good maneuverability) as a move action once per round. You must end the flight solidly supported or you fall. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your airstep sandals increases the distance you can fly by 10 feet. Chakra Bind (Feet) Your airstep sandals merge into your feet, turning your legs sky blue from your knees down to your toes. You become capable of aerial acrobatics, turning on a dime in midair with a soft burst of pale blue mist. You fly with perfect maneuverability. In practical terms, this means that you can reverse direction without paying a movement cost, you can turn freely without spending any extra movement, and you can ascend at full speed.

Ankheg Breastplate	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Ankheg Breastplate			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraThroat.ChakraTotem	PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:A thick, chitinous breastplate forms around your torso. The green plates of the armor glisten like the thorax of a living insect. Soft tissue and living muscle bind the plates together, rather than the chain and leather of conventional armor. Ankhegs are burrowing predators protected by thick plates of chitin. The totemist tradition reveres them as protectors, but it also seeks to claim the destructive power of their mandibles and their acidic spittle. Your ankheg breastplate grants you a +2 armor bonus to your Armor Class. As always, this bonus does not stack with an armor bonus from a different source (such as actual armor you might be wearing). If you have another armor bonus, the higher bonus applies. This soulmeld has no maximum Dexterity bonus, armor check penalty, or arcane spell failure. It is treated as light armor for the purpose of determining your speed and adjudicating class features dependent on armor. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your ankheg breastplate, the armor bonus granted by the soulmeld improves by 1. Chakra Bind (Throat) Green chitin spreads from your breastplate up your neck, blending into your skin there. This thickened skin seems to pulse slowly, in a rhythm unrelated to the beat of your heart or the movement of your breath. You gain the ability to spit a line of acid as a standard action. Once per minute, you can emit a line of acid that is 5 feet long plus 5 feet per point of invested essentia. Targets in the line take 2d6 points of acid damage plus 1d6 points for every point of invested essentia. They can reduce this damage by half with a successful Reflex save. Chakra Bind (Totem) Green-brown chitin spreads from your breastplate up your neck to your face, and you sprout serrated mandibles like those of a giant insect. Outside of combat, they slowly open and close without any conscious direction. In battle, you can use these terrible clenching jaws to tear the flesh of your foes. When you shift essentia to this soulmeld, the mandibles sizzle with acid. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. You can use this bite either as a primary attack (in which case it uses your full base attack bonus and adds your Strength bonus on damage rolls) or as a secondary attack (with a -5 penalty on the attack roll and applying only half your Strength bonus on your damage roll). Every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld adds 1d4 points of acid damage to your bite damage.

Apparition Ribbon	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Apparition Ribbon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraThroat			PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:A diaphanous scarf wraps around your neck, its ends trailing off into wispy tendrils that seem to follow or mimic the movement of your arms. You form incarnum into a bridge of energy between yourself and the incorporeal world of spirits and other ghostly creatures. In melee, every time you miss an incorporeal foe because of its incorporealness, you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in apparition ribbon grants you a +2 insight bonus on damage rolls against incorporeal creatures. Chakra Bind (Throat) The wispy tendrils of the scarf lengthen and surround you as you appear to become incorporeal. When you bind apparition ribbon to your throat chakra, you gain the ability to become incorporeal for brief periods of time. You gain all the benefits of the incorporeal subtype (see page 310 of the Monster Manual), including a def lection bonus equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum +1). Activating this ability is a standard action, and your incorporealness lasts for 1 round plus 1 round per point of essentia invested in the soulmeld at the time it was activated. After you activate this ability, you can't voluntarily change the soulmeld's essentia investment until the duration of incorporealness ends. If the essentia investment is decreased involuntarily to the point where the number of consecutive rounds spent incorporeal equals or exceeds the essentia invested, you immediately become corporeal. If you are within a solid object when the duration of incorporealness ends, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet that you so travel. Each day, you can spend a total number of rounds incorporeal equal to your meldshaper level.

Arcane Focus	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Arcane Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraThroat			PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:A necklace of blue crystals fits around your neck. The crystals shed a faint glow that increases in brightness when you cast a damaging spell. Drawing upon the soul energy of spellcasters and warmages, meldshapers who also cast arcane spells can use the incarnum energy to intensify spells that cause harm to others. You shape incarnum into a periapt or other trinket, known as an arcane focus, which you then wear about your neck. When you cast an arcane spell that deals damage, your spell's damage is increased by 1 point. Spells that divide their damage among multiple targets, such as magic missile, deal the extra damage once to each affected target. This soulmeld does not affect spells that do not deal damage. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your arcane focus increases the extra damage by 1 point.

Basilisk Mask	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Basilisk Mask				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow.ChakraTotem	PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:A hideous mask with red-brown scales forms around and over your face, actually floating about an inch in front of your nose. The visage is reptilian, with a protruding lower jaw and teeth jutting upward. Bony spines stick up from the top of the mask, completing the portrait of a basilisk. While the basilisk is feared primarily for its petrifying gaze, totemists also revere it as a patron of vision. Your basilisk mask grants you low-light vision. Essentia: The basilisk mask grants you darkvision with a range of 30 feet per point of essentia invested in the soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Brow) Your basilisk mask merges into your forehead, and your eyes are now clearly visible in the face of the basilisk. The visual effect is a little unsettling, but the improvement to your perception is dramatic. You gain the benefit of the Blind-Fight feat. Chakra Bind (Totem) Behind the mask, your eyes glow with a pale green radiance that is clearly visible through the eyes of the basilisk. There is a sense of weight in your forehead, but it is not entirely unpleasant-more like a power anxious to be exercised. By directing your gaze on a creature within 30 feet who can see you, you can temporarily turn that creature to stone (as the flesh to stone spell, except that the duration is only 1 round). A successful Fortitude save negates this effect. Using this ability is a full-round action.

Beast Tamer Circlet	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Beast Tamer Circlet			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraCrown.ChakraTotem			PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You channel undifferentiated soul energy into a gleaming silver band that encircles your forehead at a distance of about an inch. If you concentrate, you can hear a very quiet murmur of growls, shrieks, and other animal noises-the cacophony of the beast world. Rather than channeling the specific soul energy of a particular kind of magical beast to emulate that beast, totemists sometimes prefer to use incarnum in a more general way to improve their interactions with all beasts. You gain a +2 insight bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your beast tamer circlet increases the insight bonus by 2. Chakra Bind (Crown) Your silver circlet fuses to your head, sending silver-blue tendrils like tiny veins under your skin. The endless clamor of beast noises becomes intelligible to you-you understand the range of needs and emotions that drives these utterances-but you are still able to ignore it with a modicum of concentration. You gain the ability to speak with animals, as the spell. You can also use this ability to communicate with magical beasts that have an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. You can use this ability in any round during which you invest essentia in your beast tamer circlet. Chakra Bind (Totem) Instead of a gleaming silver band around your head, your beast tamer circlet manifests as a ring of silver hair, while all the hair on your head becomes long and coarse like a beast's mane. You gain the ability to use animal trance, as the spell. You can use this ability once per minute, and it lasts as long as you maintain concentration and have any amount of essentia invested in your beast tamer circlet, to a maximum of 1 minute per meldshaper level.

Behir Gorget	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Behir Gorget				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraThroat.ChakraTotem		PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:Incarnum forms a large, deep blue collar around your neck, like part of a suit of plate armor. The color is darker on the back and fades to pale blue in the front, and bands of gray-brown line the top and bottom. The gorget tapers to a sharp point above your breastbone. Powerful beasts that resemble dragons, behirs are revered for their dangerous electrical breath weapon. Their dozen legs grant them stability, a quality totemists seek to appropriate through this soulmeld. Their hatred of dragons makes this a popular soulmeld for totemists planning to slay a dragon-particularly a blue or bronze dragon. Your behir gorget gives you a +4 bonus to resist being bull rushed or tripped. Essentia: If you invest essentia in your behir gorget, it protects you from electricity damage. You gain resistance to electricity equal to 5 times the number of points of essentia you invest in this soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Throat) Your armored collar merges into your throat, and your neck lengthens very slightly. You can feel a constant tingling in the sides of your neck, and tiny sparks occasionally spit from your mouth when you speak-particularly when you get excited or angry. You gain the ability to project a line of lightning similar to a behir's breath weapon. Once per minute, you can emit a line of lightning that is 5 feet long plus 5 feet per point of invested essentia. Targets in the line take 2d6 points of electricity damage plus 1d6 per point of invested essentia, and they can reduce this damage by half with a successful Reflex save. Chakra Bind (Totem) As you bind your behir gorget to your totem chakra, its hard blue plating spreads up your neck to incorporate your entire head. Your face lengthens, and your jaw grows monstrous. Sharp teeth fill your mouth, allowing you to bite your foes savagely in combat. Sparks crackle in your mouth whenever you open it to bite-or even to speak. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. You can use this bite either as a primary attack (in which case it uses your full base attack bonus and adds your Strength bonus on damage rolls) or as a secondary attack (with a -5 penalty on the attack roll and applying only half your Strength bonus on your damage roll). Every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld adds 1d4 points of electricity damage to your bite damage.

Blink Shirt	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Blink Shirt				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraHeart.ChakraTotem			PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:This rough-looking garment fits over armor and other clothing and looks like it has been made of coarse brown fur, but it displays obviously magical features. The shirt seems to shift and move on its own, and it fades into a barely corporeal mist near your waist. Most disconcerting of all, patches of the garment seem transparent, as if they have temporarily shifted to some strange elsewhere. Because different parts of the garment appear phased out at different times, these patches of incorporeality seem to roam over the surface of the shirt. Blink dogs have two closely related abilities that define their hunting tactics. Totemists emulate both their shortrange teleportation and the blinking that gives them their name. Good-aligned totemists and those planning to fight displacer beasts shape this meld, invoking the blink dog's natural good alignment and their hatred for those creatures. By shaping incarnum into a shirt resembling blink dog fur, you gain the ability to teleport (as dimension door) up to 10 feet at will. Using this ability is a standard action. After using this ability, you can't take any other actions until your next turn. You cannot bring along other creatures; you affect only yourself. Essentia: Investing essentia in this soulmeld increases the distance you can teleport. For every point of essentia invested, you can teleport an additional 10 feet. Chakra Bind (Heart) The appearance of your blink shirt changes little, except that now wherever it seems transparent, you do as well. Strange patches of incorporeality float over your entire body. You can use blink as the spell (with a caster level equal to your meldshaper level). Activating or dismissing the effect is a standard action. Chakra Bind (Totem) Your posture becomes slightly hunched, giving you the merest hint of a canine appearance. Your ears also take on sharp points. You can use the dimension door ability of this soulmeld as a move action.

Bloodtalons	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Bloodtalons				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraHands.ChakraTotem			PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:Incarnum forms a pair of eagle talons around your hands. They are ghostly and insubstantial, almost like a violet mist surrounding your hands, but the three-toed shape is as clear as the sharp claws in their outline. Blood hawks (described in the Fiend Folio) are fierce birds of prey noted for their blood lust. They are similar to sharks in their frenzy while feeding-in fact, they fight beyond the threshold of death. Totemists who shape bloodtalons hope to emulate the ferocious tenacity, keen eyesight, and sheer savagery of these creatures. You can continue to fight without penalty if you are disabled or dying. When reduced to 0 hit points, you can act as if you weren't disabled (that is, you ignore the normal restriction to only a single move or standard action per turn). You do not lose 1 hit point for performing a standard or otherwise strenuous action while at 0 hit points. When reduced to -1 to -9 hit points, you do not fall unconscious. You do not automatically lose 1 hit point each round when at -1 to -9 hit points. When your current hit points drop to -10 or lower, you immediately die. Essentia: You gain a +2 bonus on Spot checks per point of essentia you invest in your bloodtalons. Chakra Bind (Hands) Rather than being surrounded by violet mist, your hands themselves turn a deep shade of violet, like the blue of incarnum mixed with rich blood red. Somehow, your hands feel eager to grasp and tear, to speed past your opponents' defenses and tear at their eyes. You gain the benefit of the Weapon Finesse feat when attacking with natural weapons. Chakra Bind (Totem) The skin of your hands becomes red-orange and scaly like the talons of a blood hawk, your fingers grow knobby and strong, and your nails lengthen into fierce talons with sharp points and edges. You can use your bloodtalons as natural weapons. You can make two claw attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage plus your Strength modifier. On the round after you hit with a claw attack, the wounds bleed for an additional 1 point of damage per point of essentia you had invested in your bloodtalons when you made the attack. Nonliving creatures are immune to this blood loss effect. Every point of essentia invested in the bloodtalons grants a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls made with the claw attacks. While the claws are shaped, you can still use your hands as normal (to hold items, cast spells, and so on), although you cannot hold an item in your hand and attack with the claws at the same time.

Bloodwar Gauntlets	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Bloodwar Gauntlets			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraArms.ChakraHands				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:Incarnum forms into black gauntlets that encase your hands and extend in heavy iron bands up your forearms to your elbows, where they end in vicious-looking spikes. They seem large for your hands and actually cover any gloves or gauntlets you might already be wearing, but they move in perfect unison with your fingers and hands. When it is very quiet, you can sometimes hear the sounds of battle coming from the night-black metal of the gauntlets. The Lower Planes are consumed in an unending battle between demons and devils, though this so-called Blood War rarely has much impact on the Material Plane. When you shape this soulmeld, you channel some of the raw, savage ferocity of that eternal conflict, using it to increase your own power in combat. While you wear your bloodwar gauntlets, you gain a +1 morale bonus on melee attack rolls. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your bloodwar gauntlets, you gain a +1 morale bonus on melee damage rolls. Chakra Bind (Arms) Your bloodwar gauntlets bind themselves to your wrists and forearms. Instead of separate rings of metal extending up your arms, they now form a solid sheath of completely unreflective metal in which fiendish visages manifest and subside, always contorted with rage and pain. You can use a standard action to release the soulmeld's violent energy in a tumultuous blast, unshaping the soulmeld in the process. The blast deals 3d6 points of damage for every point of essentia invested to all creatures within a 20-footradius burst, excluding you. A successful Fortitude save halves this damage. Chakra Bind (Hands) Your bloodwar gauntlets bind themselves to your hands, shrinking to better fit them. The metal fingertips of the gauntlets are long and sharply pointed. They sometimes seem to drip blood, though the liquid that falls from them vanishes almost as soon as it touches the ground. You gain a +4 bonus on rolls made to confirm critical threats.

Bluesteel Bracers	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Bluesteel Bracers			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraArms				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:You harness the soul energy of mighty warriors past, present, and future, shaping that incarnum into bands of bright blue steel that surround your wrists and lower arms. You feel a soft tingling in your wrists that grows stronger when danger is near. Because war has always been a part of mortal history, warrior souls are plentiful. Meldshapers can readily tap into this font of martial knowledge to improve their own prowess on the field of battle, in particular honing the sense of approaching danger that allows skilled warriors to get the drop on their foes. Your bluesteel bracers enhance your reactions and keep your mind in a state of constant battle readiness, granting you a +2 insight bonus on initiative checks. Essentia: Investing essentia in your bluesteel bracers enhances your ability to deal damage in combat. The bracers provide an insight bonus on weapon damage rolls equal to the number of points of essentia that you invest in the soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Arms) Your bluesteel bracers affix themselves to your arms, extending swirling patterns of bright metallic blue up your biceps. When danger is near, your nearby allies share your sense of it and find themselves more ready for battle. All allies within 30 feet of you when initiative is rolled gain the +2 bonus on initiative granted by this soulmeld.

Brass Mane	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Brass Mane				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraThroat.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:This feral mask has leonine qualities, including a coarse mane of thick, brass-colored hair. Onlookers familiar with the mighty dragonnes recognize the similarities between those fearsome desert predators and the features of the mask. Dragonnes are vicious and deadly hunters. Because of their terrible roar, totemists associate them with fear and don brass manes to strike terror into enemy hearts. While you wear your brass mane, you gain a +4 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld increases the competence bonus it grants on Intimidate checks by 2. Chakra Bind (Throat) The hair of your brass mane extends down your neck, forming brassy scales that cover your throat and reach down to your breastbone. Your voice gets louder unless you make a conscious effort to keep it quiet. Once per minute, you can loose a devastating roar. All creatures except dragonnes within 10 feet must succeed on a Will save or become fatigued. The range of this effect is extended by 10 feet for every point of essentia invested in the soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Totem) Your face blends into the mask, your jaws growing long and sprouting huge fangs. You can make powerful bite attacks to tear the flesh of your foes. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. You can use this bite either as a primary attack (in which case it uses your full base attack bonus and adds your Strength bonus on damage rolls) or as a secondary attack (with a -5 penalty on the attack roll and applying only half your Strength bonus on your damage roll). Every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld grants a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls made with the bite attack.

Cerulean Sandals	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Cerulean Sandals			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraFeet				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:Incarnum forms into a pair of sandals that surround your feet and any other footwear you might have on. The sandals resemble blue crystal ice, but just beneath the surface, they seem to flow like water. To shape cerulean sandals, you draw on soul energy with ties to the Astral Plane, channeling qualities of weightlessness to enhance your movement abilities. Your cerulean sandals allow you to walk on water (as if under the effect of a water walk spell). Essentia: You can invest essentia to increase your base speed with cerulean sandals. Every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld grants an enhancement bonus of +5 feet to your base land speed. This bonus applies only to land speed and does not improve any other forms of movement, such as climb or fly speeds. Chakra Bind (Feet) Your feet and lower legs are encased in a sheath of blue-gray energy. This substance resembles ice, but motes of light like tiny stars drift through it as well. You can use dimension door as the spell, up to a total distance of 10 feet per meldshaper level. You can use this ability (in increments of 10 feet) any number of times, until the total distance has been traversed, at which point the soulmeld unshapes. This requires a standard action to activate.

Crystal Helm	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Crystal Helm				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraCrown				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:You shape incarnum into a light helm that surrounds your head and anything you might be wearing on it, including another helm. The substance of this helm is transparent crystal with a faceted appearance. As it rests over your head, you can almost feel a barrier erected behind your eyes, barring the way to those who would intrude into your mind. Crystal in its many forms is frequently associated with mental powers, hence its widespread use by characters with psionic powers. With this soulmeld, you shape incarnum into a crystalline form to draw on its protective qualities. The soulmeld provides protection against mental effects, granting you a +2 resistance bonus on Will saving throws against charm and compulsion. Essentia: You can increase the protective properties granted by a crystal helm by investing essentia in the soulmeld. You gain a deflection bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of points of essentia that you invest in the crystal helm. Chakra Bind (Crown) Your crystal helm settles snugly around your head, and tendrils of cold power work their way through your body. If you close your eyes, you can almost see your own hands glowing like a mystic crystal suffused with unearthly radiance. Like the invisible power of magical force, your attacks slice through the boundaries between worlds. Your melee attacks gain the force descriptor, making them useful against incorporeal foes.

Diadem Of Purelight	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Diadem Of Purelight			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraCrown				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.63	ASPECT:Descriptors|Light	ASPECT:Chakra||Crown											A shimmering ring of incarnum energy wreathes your head, shedding a pure blue-white light. The light clearly outlines the shapes of creatures and objects it illuminates, enhancing your visual acuity. The light of souls is pure, highlighting the nuances of physical forms. This soulmeld draws upon that power to shed light on the meldshaper's surroundings. You shape incarnum into a circlet that illuminates the area around you. Your diadem of purelight sheds light as a torch, illuminating a 20-foot radius with bright illumination (and out to a 40-foot radius of shadowy illumination). Creatures gain a +2 insight bonus on Spot checks when attempting to see anything within the radius of illumination (including within the shadowy illumination). For the purpose of interacting with darkness spells, the diadem of purelight is treated as a light spell of a level equal to its invested essentia. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your diadem of purelight increases the radius of illumination by 10 feet. The radius of shadowy illumination is always double the radius of bright illumination. For example, a diadem of purelight with 2 points of invested essentia sheds bright light to a radius of 40 feet, and shadowy illumination to a radius of 80 feet. Chakra Bind (Crown) The light from the headband becomes steady and constant, amplifying the contrast between different creatures and objects. The diadem of purelight negates any concealment less than total concealment within the radius of its bright light. This has no effect on invisibility or other forms of total concealment, but creatures protected by fog, blur spells, and the like gain no concealment from such effects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	
Disenchanter Mask	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Disenchanter Mask			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You shape incarnum into a silvery mask with a long snout, clubbed protrusions at the crown, and a long, forked tongue. The silver scales of the mask glint and gleam in the light, and the tongue seems to sway of its own accord. Disenchanters (described in the Fiend Folio) are huge, surly beasts that feed on magical energy. By shaping this soulmeld, totemists hope to gain the power to combat magic-particularly against foes armed with large numbers of magic items. You can use a detect magic effect as the spell, with a range of 10 feet. You can use this ability as often as desired, but no more than once per round (as a standard action). Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your disenchanter mask, the range of its detect magic effect increases by 10 feet. Chakra Bind (Brow) Your disenchanter mask binds to your forehead, and your eyes replace the glassy black eyes in the mask's sockets. Colors seem somehow more alive to your sight-particularly the colors of spell effects and items that you know to be magical. When using this soulmeld's detect magic ability, you can instantly determine the number, strength, and location of each magical aura present as if you had been concentrating for 3 rounds. You must still make Spellcraft checks as normal to determine the school of magic involved in each aura. Chakra Bind (Totem) Your face lengthens and shapes into the mask you wear, and the dangling tongue of the mask becomes your own tongue. As you extend it, you can practically taste magic in the air, and when you use the tongue to drain magic, it tastes strong and sweet, almost like a liqueur. You can use the long tongue of your disenchanter mask to make a melee touch attack as a standard action. (You cannot use the tongue as a natural secondary weapon, nor can you make any other attacks in the same round as you make a tongue attack.) The tongue has a reach 5 feet longer than your natural reach, but you cannot use it to make attacks of opportunity. It uses your normal base attack bonus. If you hit with the tongue attack, you deal no damage but have a chance to temporarily suppress a magic item that the target might have. Unless you choose a specific item held or worn by the target (such as "the sword he holds" or "his bracers"), you affect magic items in the following order: shield, armor, helmet, item in hand, cloak, stowed or sheathed weapon, bracers, clothing, jewelry (including rings), and anything remaining. To suppress the item, you must succeed on a meldshaper level check (1d20 + your meldshaper level) against a DC of 11 + the magic item's caster level. Success means that the item's magical properties are suppressed for 10 minutes. You can also use this ability to temporarily suppress the magic of a specific soulmeld, but you must specify the soulmeld to be affected; otherwise you affect a magic item instead. Use the soulmeld's meldshaper level as its caster level.

Displacer Mantle	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Displacer Mantle			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraShoulders.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:This cloak of blue-black fur wraps around your shoulders and hangs down your back to the waist. The fur bends and catches light strangely, actually creating a slight blurring effect around your entire body. Displacer beasts are vicious predators, but to the totemist they symbolize stealth and deception. With this soulmeld, you hope to claim the displacer beast's light-bending deception to conceal and protect yourself. The displacer mantle slightly blurs your outline, providing a +4 competence bonus on Hide checks. Essentia: The competence bonus on Hide checks increases by 2 for every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Shoulders) As you bind the mantle to your shoulders, its midnight hue spreads into the skin of your shoulders and upper arms. A light-bending glamer surrounds you, shifting and wavering your outline. Your displacer mantle surrounds you with a glamer similar to a blur spell, granting you concealment (20%% miss chance). A true seeing effect allows the user to see your position, but see invisibility has no effect. Chakra Bind (Totem) A pair of tentacles extends from your shoulder blades. They end in pads ridged with sharp horn, allowing you to lash out even at distant foes to batter and tear them. As a full-round action, you can make two tentacle attacks using your full base attack bonus. Each tentacle deals 1d4 points of damage plus your Strength modifier. The tentacles have reach equal to your normal natural reach plus 5 feet; however, you do not have sufficient control over the tentacles to make attacks of opportunity with them. Every point of essentia invested in the displacer mantle grants you a +1 enhancement bonus on damage rolls made with the tentacle attacks.

Dissolving Spittle	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Dissolving Spittle			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraThroat				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:Incarnum forms a metallic blue-green torc around your neck. The ends of the torc resemble black or copper dragons facing each other in front of your throat. A constant bitter taste floods your mouth, but it seems to make the flavor of certain foods more enjoyable-particularly well-cooked meat. The infamous incarnate Murthien the Soul-Render, for all his forays into the abomination that is necrocarnum, also used dissolving spittle almost as a calling card. While this meld is favored by chaotic and evil incarnates because of acid's association with both suffering and dissolution, incarnates of all alignments find acidic spittle a useful weapon against a variety of opponents. As a standard action, you can spit a glob of acid at a target within 30 feet. This requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Using dissolving spittle provokes attacks of opportunity. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your dissolving spittle increases the damage dealt by 1d6 points. Chakra Bind (Throat) Instead of a torc around your neck, the writhing shape of a twoheaded dragon arcs around your throat in blue-green scales. Tendrils of midnight blue extend up your neck and down into your shoulders like diseased veins. When you use your ability to spit acid at an opponent, the target takes normal damage in the round you spit acid. You also roll again for damage 1 round later.

Dread Carapace	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Dread Carapace				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraArms.CharkaFeet.ChakraHeart.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:Incarnum forms into a heavy, caramel-brown carapace covering your back. Short spines protrude from this shell, and light gleams from its surface. Though it has no actual protective value (unless you bind it to your heart chakra), the carapace fills you with the destructive power of the tarrasque. Possibly the most dreaded of all magical beasts, the tarrasque is also the only magical beast whose power is channeled and embodied in two different soulmelds-dread carapace and totem avatar. Totemists who shape dread carapace can emulate a variety of the tarrasque's many aspects-primary among them its sheer power in melee combat. While your dread carapace is shaped, you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls when you are using a bite attack, or a +1 bonus when you are using a claw or other natural attack. In exchange, you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls with natural weapons. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your dread carapace increases your attack penalty by 1 and your damage bonus by 2 (for bite attacks) or 1 (for other natural weapons). Thus, if you invest 5 points of essentia in this soulmeld, you take a -6 penalty on attack rolls and gain a +12 bonus on damage rolls with a bite, or +6 with a different natural weapon. Chakra Bind (Arms) While the appearance of your dread carapace is unchanged, your upper arms manifest scaly plates, while spikes emerge from your elbows. At the same time, any natural weapons you possess become more deadly-sharper, longer, better able to slice through skin and armor to tear at vulnerable flesh. The threat range of any natural attacks you possess (either naturally or as a result of another soulmeld) is doubled. This doesn't stack with any other effect that increases the threat range of your natural weapon. Chakra Bind (Feet) While the appearance of your dread carapace is unchanged, your legs become increasingly muscular, and their shape alters slightly so that you more naturally move on just your toes and the balls of your feet. Once per minute, you can add an enhancement bonus of +60 feet to your speed for 1 round. This enhancement bonus is increased by 10 feet for every point of essentia invested in your dread carapace. Chakra Bind (Heart) Your dread carapace takes on a highly reflective sheen, suggesting the tarrasque's ability to reflect spells back on their casters. Spells have a hard time reaching through your carapace to affect you. You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + 4 per point of essentia you invest in your dread carapace. Chakra Bind (Totem) Two mighty horns jut from your head. Though they are useless in combat, they alter your appearance, making your countenance quite fearsome. When you charge, your visage suggests something utterly inhuman, striking fear into the hearts of your foes. When you charge, all enemies within 60 feet who can see you become shaken for 1 round (Will negates).

Enigma Helm	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Enigma Helm				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraCrown				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:You form incarnum into a shadowy helm floating above and around your head. Shadows swirl like rising smoke beneath its surface. The helm wraps itself like a cloak around your mind, protecting your secrets and shielding your will. Meldshapers favor this soulmeld to ward their minds from divination and mind-affecting spells. They speak of the incarnum involved as the essence of secrets or the soul of mystery. Your enigma helm protects you from div i na tions. While wearing this soulmeld, you become difficult to detect by divination spells (as the nondetection spell). If a divination is attempted against you, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your meldshaper level. Essentia: You gain an enhancement bonus on Will saves equal to the number of points of essentia invested. Chakra Bind (Crown) Your enigma helm rests solidly on your head. In the center of your forehead, a dusky gem holds swirling shadowstuff-and it's not clear whether the gem is part of the helm or part of your own head. Any attempt to charm you is redirected to the gem in your forehead. As a result, you gain complete immunity to enchantment (charm) effects.

Fearsome Mask	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Fearsome Mask				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow				PRECLASS:1,Soulborn=1					DESC:You shape incarnum into a ferocious-looking mask that covers your face. It resembles a powerful outsider of your alignment, either majestic in splendor or terrible in its evil. Somewhere deep in your mind is a quivering knot of fear, but you find that you can channel that fear and use it to intimidate others. Fear, some would argue, is among the most powerful forces in the multiverse. The lives of many are dominated by it-some avoid all danger and conflict because of their fear, while others ride to power by inspiring fear in others. In shaping this soulmeld, you draw on the primordial power of fear, acknowledging the fear that lives in your own heart even as you direct it outward to inspire fear in those around you. While wearing the fearsome mask, you gain a +2 insight bonus on Intimidate checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your fearsome mask increases the insight bonus by 2. Chakra Bind (Brow) Your eyes, clearly visible through your fearsome mask, blaze with fiery wrath that strikes terror into the hearts of those that meet your gaze. Your gaze causes enemy creatures (but not allies) to become shaken for 1 minute (Will negates). This otherwise functions as normal for a gaze attack. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Fellmist Robe	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Fellmist Robe				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraSoul				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:Incarnum coalesces around your body into a sheath of gray mist. It hangs about you like a thick fog that moves with you, creating the illusion that you are drifting over the ground rather than walking. This robe of mist masks your true location, protecting you from ranged attacks. Some incarnates imagine they are channeling soul energy from swamp-dwelling creatures, while others imagine their fellmist robes are shaped from the ghostly spirits of the dead. Your fellmist robe provides you with minor concealment (10%% miss chance) against any attacker more than 5 feet from you. You do not suffer the same drawback-your attacks against nonadjacent targets are unaffected. A strong wind (21 mph or greater) disperses the fellmist robe, though it reforms 1 round after the wind stops. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in your fellmist robe improves the concealment slightly, increasing the miss chance by 5%% (up to a maximum of 50%%). Chakra Bind (Soul) Your fellmist robe draws closer to your body, at the same time growing denser and shrouding your form more effectively-even against adjacent foes. Your fellmist robe provides its concealment against even adjacent attackers. It resists winds up to 50 mph, though stronger winds still temporarily disperse the robe.

Flame Cincture	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Flame Cincture				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraWaist				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:Incarnum forms into a cord of blue fire, which you wear tied around your waist. Its flames are cool to the touch. The loose ends dance around your legs like tongues of flame with wills of their own. When you are exposed to fire, the flames of your belt flare brightly, as if feeding on the fire around you. The soulborn Cecylla the Puresoul was renowned as a model of monastic piety who favored a clerical appearance. She always wore vestments over her armor, and a flame cincture gathered her alb around her waist. When she slew the mighty dragon Garragauth the Red, it is certain that her flame cincture saved her life. When you shape f lame cincture, you gain resistance to fire 10. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in your flame cincture increases your resistance to fire by 5. Chakra Bind (Waist) Energy attacks are not simply absorbed and dispersed, but instead the energy is bound within the belt, eagerly awaiting release. You can release a blast of fire from your flame cincture. Whenever your flame cincture prevents damage, the energy remains latent within the cord for 1 round. On your next turn, you can release the stored energy as a swift action to blast any target within 60 feet. The energy blast deals fire damage equal to the amount of damage prevented by the flame cincture in the previous round. A successful Reflex save reduces the damage by half.

Frost Helm	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Frost Helm				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraCrown.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:Incarnum forms into a bluewhite helm resembling the bizarre head of a frost worm. It floats above the top of your head, its strange lumpy shape rising to a tall nodule at the front and top. Frost worms are terrible arctic predators known for the weird stunning trill they produce from the nodules atop their heads. Totemists in cold lands favor this soulmeld, claiming the frost worm's power to protect themselves from the cold environment. They also use frost helm to mimic the frost worm's trill and its frigid breath weapon. Because of the frost worm's legendary hatred for the remorhaz, totemists don this meld when leading remorhaz hunting parties. While wearing a frost helm, you can exist comfortably in conditions between -50 and 90? Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves. Your equipment is likewise protected. Essentia: If you invest essentia in your frost helm, it also protects you from cold damage. You gain resistance to cold equal to 5 times the number of points of essentia you invest in this soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Crown) Your frost helm fuses to the top of your head, actually opening a breathing channel in the strange nodule at the helm's crown. As a standard action, you can project a ray of cold energy from your forehead, reminiscent of a frost worm's breath weapon. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit a creature with this ray. If you hit, the ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage plus an additional 1d6 points for every point of essentia you invest in your frost helm. Chakra Bind (Totem) Your frost helm fuses to your head and seems to spread downward, changing the appearance of your upper face to resemble the head of a frost worm. Your eyes meld into the helm's strange nodule, your cheeks twist into lumpy protrusions, and the skin of your face grows thick and blue-white. As a standard action, you can produce a trilling sound that stuns opponents within 20 feet. You can target one creature plus one additional creature per point of essentia you invest in your frost helm. Targets must succeed on a Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. If attacked or violently shaken (a full-round action), a victim is allowed another saving throw. Once a creature has resisted or broken the effect, it cannot be affected by your frost helm's trill for 24 hours. Frost worms are immune to this effect.

Girallon Arms	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Girallon Arms				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraArms.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:Incarnum coalesces around your arms and upper torso, forming blue-white fur that seems to enhance your arm and chest muscles. It also extends from your fingers to form ghostly claws that, despite their insubstantial appearance, help you gain purchase while climbing or grappling. Totemists hope to claim the savage ferocity of the girallon as their own by shaping this meld. Known for its great strength and fierce claws, the girallon is a totem of power and aggression. Your girallon arms grant you a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks and grapple checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in your girallon arms increases the bonus on Climb checks and grapple checks by 2. Chakra Bind (Arms) The blue-white fur of your girallon arms grows longer at your forearms, forming tufts of hair near your elbows. If you hit a single target with at least two claw attacks, whether these attacks come from your girallon arms, a different soulmeld, your own innate abilities, or some other source, you can latch onto the opponent's body and tear the flesh. This attack automatically deals double claw damage, including double your Strength bonus. Chakra Bind (Totem) Incarnum forms two additional, powerful arms that spring out from your ribs. These spirit arms mirror the movements of your real arms. All four of your arms are tipped with long claws that no longer seem ghostly, but quite real-and quite sharp. You gain four claws that you can use as natural weapons, dealing 1d4 points of damage with each claw. You can make a single claw attack as a primary attack, using your full attack bonus and adding your Strength bonus on your damage roll. You can make up to three additional claw attacks as secondary attacks, following either a primary claw attack or an attack with a weapon. These secondary attacks have a -5 penalty on the attack rolls and apply half your Strength bonus on damage. If you have a shield in your off hand, you cannot make any secondary claw attacks. Every point of essentia you invest in your girallon arms grants you a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with your claw attacks.

They appear moist but are dry to the touch. By focusing the energy of souls damned for eternity, you form green gloves of incarnum that writhe with evil power. When you touch a foe, the condemned souls poison the target, forcing their hopeless will against it. Once per round, you can attempt to inflict a terrible, mind-wracking poison on a foe with a melee touch attack. The poison deals 1 point of Wisdom damage immediately and another 1 point of Wisdom damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated by a Fortitude save. No creature can be affected by the gloves more than once in a 24-hour period. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your gloves increases the Wisdom damage dealt (both primary and secondary damage) by 1 point. Chakra Bind (Hands) The gloves merge with your hands, giving your hands a green cast. Your fingertips drip with viscous slime. When gloves of the poisoned soul are bound to your hands chakra, the poison also deals Strength damage equal to the amount of Wisdom damage dealt (one save resists both effects).

Gorgon Mask	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Gorgon Mask				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraThroat.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:Incarnum forms a mask resembling the head of a steel-plated bull, complete with long, arcing silver horns. The mask's eyes are empty black pits. Totemists revere the gorgon as an icon of passive strength and endurance. Its steel-plated hide and great fortitude, as well as its association with petrification, signify the unyielding strength of a cliff wall standing against the sea. At the same time, its aggressive nature leads totemists to emulate the gorgon's ability to crush its foes beneath its hooves. While wearing a gorgon mask, you gain a +1 resistance bonus on Fortitude saves and a +2 resistance bonus on any check or saving throw to resist being bull rushed, tripped, overrun, or trampled. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your gorgon mask increases your resistance bonuses by 1. Chakra Bind (Throat) The dusky, metallic scales of your gorgon mask extend down your neck, forming a sharp ridge along your upper spine. Wisps of green smoke escape from your mouth. You gain the ability to breathe a cloud of petrifying gas on an adjacent foe. If the target fails a Fortitude save, it turns to stone, as the flesh to stone spell. You can use this ability once per day. Chakra Bind (Totem) The metallic scales of your gorgon mask extend down over your shoulders, lending bulk and solidity to your frame. You feel strength coursing through your legs in particular, giving you the ability to run down your foes and crush them beneath your feet. You gain the ability to make a trample attack. As a full-round action, you can move up to twice your speed and literally run over any creature equal to your own size or smaller. You merely have to move over the opponents in your path; any creature whose space is completely covered by your space is subject to the trample attack. If a target's space is larger than 5 feet, it is considered trampled only if you move over all the squares it occupies. Your trample attack deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage (or 1d6 points if you are Small) plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier. If you are larger than Medium or smaller than Small, the damage scales up or down accordingly (see page 114 of the Player's Handbook). Trampled opponents can attempt attacks of opportunity, but these take a -4 penalty. (Opponents whose space is larger than 5 feet and whom you do not trample can also make attacks of opportunity at the same penalty.) An opponent can give up its attack of opportunity and instead attempt a Reflex save to take half damage from your trample. You can deal trampling damage to each target only once per round, no matter how many times your movement takes you over a target creature.

Great Raptor Mask	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Great Raptor Mask			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You shape incarnum into a large mask that surrounds your whole head, resembling the head of a giant eagle or a giant owl. The feathered plumage is brown and white with the faintest tinge of purple-blue, and the mask's large, glassy eyes gleam sky blue. Giant eagles and giant owls are revered for their exceptional eyesight. Totemists lay claim to the power of these intelligent birds to see distant objects more clearly and, more broadly, to escape from danger through quick reflexes and quicker thinking. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Spot checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your great raptor mask increases the competence bonus by 2. Chakra Bind (Brow) Your great raptor mask has large eyes that gather every scrap of light and reflect it as a pale, blue-green glow. The mask is fused to your forehead, and your eyes are melded into the eyes of the mask-which no longer look glassy, but very much alive. You gain the superior low-light vision of a giant owl, allowing you to see five times as far as a human can in dim light. Chakra Bind (Totem) Your head transforms to take on the appearance of a giant eagle, becoming one with your great raptor mask. While still enhancing your vision, this soulmeld also heightens your reflexive reaction to danger, allowing you to dodge entirely out of the way of dangerous effects. You gain evasion. With a successful Reflex save against an attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage.

Heart Of Fire	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Heart Of Fire				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraWaist.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:A rough stone of blazing red hangs at the center of a loose belt around your waist. You feel warmth spreading from the stone into your body, though it is not enough to ward off extreme cold. At the sight of a frost giant or some other creature of cold, however, that warmth surges through your body like consuming fire, eager to sear your opponents' flesh. The remorhaz is one of the most fearsome predators of arctic regions. Unlike many creatures native to those realms, it is not immune to cold damage; it endures the extremes of winter temperatures by generating huge amounts of heat. Totemists shape this soulmeld when fighting frost giants (since the remorhaz considers frost giants to be prey) and when they hunt large game in cold climes. You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures with the cold subtype. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your heart of fire increases your insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against cold creatures by 1. Chakra Bind (Waist) A red glow suffuses your body, concentrated in your abdomen. Rather than a blazing red stone at your waist, your heart of fire is subsumed into your flesh, filling your body with its fiery fury. Any creature striking you with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of fire damage per point of essentia you invest in your heart of fire. Weapons striking you take the same damage, but most objects take only half damage from fire (divide the damage dealt by 2 before applying the weapon's hardness). Creatures grappling you take this damage every round at the end of your turn, regardless of whether you succeed or fail on a grapple check to deal damage to them. This damage does not stack with the fire damage provided by the heart of fire's totem chakra bind. Chakra Bind (Totem) The heat of the blazing stone at your waist spreads through your body, lashing out through your attacks at any opponent you face. When you enter combat, your skin glows red with the fiery power coursing through your veins. Your natural weapons or unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d4 points of fire damage per point of essentia you invest in your heart of fire. Creatures grappling you take this dam age every round at the end of your turn, regardless of whether you succeed or fail on a grapple check to deal dam age to them.

Hunting is one of the primordial activities of the humanoid races, a sport of survival. By calling upon the soul energy of mighty hunters past, present, and future, meldshapers hope to gain insight into their talents. Your hunter's circlet grants you a +2 insight bonus on Heal and Survival checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your hunter's circlet increases the insight bonus by 2. Chakra Bind (Crown) The sky-blue ivy of your hunter's circlet weaves into your hair, winding down to your shoulders. You gain the benefit of the Track feat. Chakra Bind (Totem) There is no change to your own appearance or that of the circlet, but from your perspective, the world around you changes enormously. It is suddenly alive with smells-from obvious, overpowering odors you noticed before but not in such richness of detail, to subtle scents unlike anything in your experience. You channel beast energy to gain a limited version of the scent special quality. You can detect opponents by sense of smell, noting their presence if they are within 15 feet (assuming you cannot discern their presence by other means). You can note the direction of a creature's scent by taking a full-round action to sniff the air. You also gain a +4 competence bonus on Survival checks to track a creature when you can bring your sense of smell to bear on the task.

Illusion Veil	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Illusion Veil				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:You shape incarnum into a wispy veil, which fades into invisibility when you wear it. When you cast an illusion spell, tendrils of incarnum surround and merge with the illusory effect, making it more vibrant and believable. A meldshaper can pull soul energy into his illusion spells, reinforcing the illusion with the memories of that which was once real. Primarily used to increase the effectiveness of silent image and similar spells, some meldshaper/spellcasters use illusion veil to weave incarnum into shadow magic, such as shadow evocation. While wearing the illusion veil, you can focus the energy of incarnum into visible and nearly tangible shapes. These wisps of energy enhance your illusion spells, making them seem more real. You gain a +1 insight bonus to the save DCs of your illusion spells and spell-like abilities. Essentia: Whenever you cast an illusion spell or use an illusion-based spell-like ability, you add 1 round to the duration for every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld at the time of casting. This has no effect on a spell with an instantaneous duration, such as a shadow evocation used to duplicate fireball. Chakra Bind (Brow) A dim blue glow emanates from your eyes. A brief flash, visible only to you, scans across your field of vision periodically, outlining creatures and objects while heightening your awareness. When your illusion veil is bound to your brow chakra, you can more easily perceive false reality. You can see invisibility, as the spell. You also gain an insight bonus on Spot checks and on saves against illusion spells equal to the number of points of essentia invested in your illusion veil.

Midnight blue in color, the impulse boots seem to be made of smooth, supple leather. You channel the spirits of rogues and scoundrels, barbarians, and all who think quickly on their feet, forming that elemental quality into boots that help you do the same. Your impulse boots grant you the ability to avoid dangerous effects. While wearing this soulmeld, you gain the uncanny dodge ability (see page 50 of the Player's Handbook). Essentia: You gain an enhancement bonus on Reflex saves equal to the number of points of essentia invested. Chakra Bind (Feet) Your impulse boots merge with your feet, and extend their midnight- blue color in tendrils reaching up your legs to your waist, like snaking veins just under your skin. You gain the evasion ability (see page 50 of the Player's Handbook).		
Incarnate Avatar	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Incarnate Avatar			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraSoul				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:You gather incarnum around you to form a second body encasing your own, a physical form superimposed over your body, clothing, and armor. In form, it resembles one of the most powerful champions of your alignment: a slaad, inevitable, angel, or yugoloth. Its movements-even its facial expressions-are in perfect synchronization with your own, so that in every way you appear to be the imposing avatar of your alignment's ideals. Incarnates channel soul energy that conforms to the ideals of their alignment, so in some ways this soulmeld exemplifies the nature of the incarnate class. The incarnum used to shape an incarnate avatar comes from the outer-planar embodiments of the incarnate's alignment and takes their form. In shaping this meld, incarnates hope to transcend their own mortal frames and attain the perfect embodiment of their alignment ideals represented by the avatar. The appearance of your incarnate avatar depends on your alignment. Chaos: Your incarnate avatar resembles a blue slaad. The slaad form is hulking and brutish, with enormous claws and a toothy maw. Evil: Your incarnate avatar has the form of a nycaloth: a four-armed, gargoylelike humanoid with green skin and (nonfunctional) batlike wings. Good: Your incarnate avatar takes the form of an astral deva, with pearl-white skin and (nonfunctional) whitefeathered wings. Law: Your incarnate avatar resembles a marut, a powerful humanoid form with golden armor over an onyx body. Unlike other soulmelds, the incarnate avatar provides no benefit without the investment of essentia. Incarnate avatar is treated as a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful effect, based on your alignment. Essentia: Investing essentia in your incarnate avatar gives you a specific benefit depending on your alignment. Chaos: You gain a +1 insight bonus on ranged attack rolls for every point of essentia that you invest in this soulmeld. Evil: You gain a +2 insight bonus on melee damage rolls for every point of essentia that you invest in this soulmeld. Good: You gain a +1 insight bonus to your Armor Class for every point of essentia that you invest in this soulmeld. Law: You gain a +1 insight bonus on melee attack rolls for every point of essentia that you invest in this soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Soul) Your body transforms into the appearance of your incarnate avatar. There is no longer any distinction between its hands and yours, its feet and yours, its heart and yours. You are imbued with the purest essence of your alignment-it fills your soul and spurs you to action. At the same time, it grants you greater power to help you live out your convictions. You gain an ability based on your alignment. Chaos: You gain an enhancement bonus of +30 feet to your base land speed. Evil: You can fly at a speed of 30 feet (good maneuverability). Good: You can f ly at a speed of 30 feet (good maneuverability). Law: You gain immunity to daze, paralysis, petrification, and stun, as well as to any magical effect that would slow you.

Incarnate Weapon	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Incarnate Weapon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraArms				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:Incarnum forms into a one-handed melee weapon that embodies your alignment. The weapon seems large for your hand, but it is balanced perfectly for you to wield it. Clutching it in your hand, you feel it resonate with your deepest convictions and firmest beliefs, and it hums with power. In the hands of an incarnate, alignment is literally a weapon. The incarnate Phanallashtam the Lawbringer is remembered almost as much for the Sword of Law he used to smite the Chaos Dragon as for the legal code he introduced to the world at the birth of civilization. Phanallashtam claimed that the two were one and the same: The Sword of Law was all law in metallic form, slicing through disorder with a sharp, clean cut. You shape incarnum into a melee weapon (sized normally for you despite its overlarge appearance) that is particularly harmful to creatures of the opposing alignment. Damage you deal with the weapon gains the alignment descriptor matching your devoted cause and penetrates damage reduction accordingly. Chaotic incarnates create a battleaxe, evil incarnates create a flail, good incarnates create a warhammer, and lawful incarnates create a longsword. Nonproficiency penalties never apply to the use of an incarnate weapon, though any feats with effects that apply to a particular kind of weapon (such as Weapon Focus) function normally. Your incarnate weapon cannot be sundered or otherwise destroyed (except by effects that unshape soulmelds). If your incarnate weapon leaves your hand for any reason, it returns to your grasp at the beginning of your next turn. If that is impossible, it falls at your feet (but attempts to return again on your next turn). Any other creature attempting to wield your incarnate weapon gains none of its special benefits (but can wield it as a normal weapon of that kind). Incarnate weapon is treated as a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful effect, based on your alignment. Essentia: The incarnate weapon gains an enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the number of points of essentia you invest in it. Chakra Bind (Arms) Bands of steel form around your forearms. When you hold your incarnate weapon, a chain of nearly invisible blue incarnum connects it to the steel bracer on your weapon hand, channeling the force of your conviction directly to your weapon. As a move action, you can charge the incarnate weapon with the stunning power of pure conviction. If the next melee attack that you make is successful, the target (as long as at least one component of its alignment is opposed to your devoted alignment) must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned until the beginning of your next turn. If the attack is unsuccessful, the charge is lost with no effect. As long as you have the incarnate weapon soulmeld shaped, you can continue to charge the weapon with this stunning force, but the weapon can only ever hold one charge of this power at a time.

Keeneye Lenses	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Keeneye Lenses				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow.ChakraSoul				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:Incarnum forms a pair of transparent blue lenses that hover in front of your eyes. As you peer through them, the world does not take on their blue color, but you find yourself more easily able to notice small details, even at long distances. By shaping this soulmeld, you channel the soul energy of sharp-witted scouts and spies to improve your eyesight. The contemporary incarnate N!doka the North Star is never seen without incarnate lenses shaped due to the number of attempts made on her life by doppelgangers and other shapechangers. While you have keeneye lenses shaped, you gain a +4 insight bonus on Spot checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your keeneye lenses increases the insight bonus by 2. Chakra Bind (Brow) Instead of blue lenses hovering before you, the actual lenses of your eyes gain the blue tinge of incarnum. To an outside observer, your eyes look like solid blue orbs, although some distinction between the blue "white," the iris, and the pupil of your eyes is still noticeable. To you, the world simply seems sharp and clear-even things that are invisible to unaided sight. You gain the ability to see invisible creatures and objects normally (as if under the effect of a see invisibility spell). Chakra Bind (Soul) Neither your appearance nor that of your keeneye lenses changes at all, but the way you see the world changes dramatically. It is as though you are seeing into a different layer of reality, piercing some veil of obscurity to see beyond mere appearances. You see all things as they truly are, as if you were constantly under the effect of a true seeing spell.

Kraken Mantle	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Kraken Mantle				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraArms.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:Incarnum forms into a mantle around your shoulders and torso, resembling the triangular mantle around a kraken's body. It is smooth and sleek to the touch, and it lets you glide through water as if you were born to it. An evil ruler of the aquatic depths, the kraken is, above all, a fast and competent swimmer. Totemists revere the creature and claim its abilities to swim and breathe water, as well as the power of its many arms for grabbing and grappling. A kraken mantle greatly enhances your ability to swim, giving you a +8 competence bonus on Swim checks. With a successful Swim check, you can move at up to your speed (as a full-round action) or at one-half your speed (as a move action). Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your kraken mantle increases your effective speed for the purposes of swimming by 5 feet. For example, if you have a base land speed of 30 feet and invest 4 points of essentia in your kraken mantle, you can swim 50 feet (30 + [4 ? 5 feet]) as a full-round action or 25 feet as a move action. Chakra Bind (Arms) The smooth, sleek substance of your mantle spreads down to your upper arms, becoming one with your flesh. Your arms themselves grow slightly more flexible, helping you gain purchase on a grappled foe. They also gain a measure of constricting strength, helping you squeeze the life from your enemies just as the kraken does. You gain a bonus on grapple checks equal to the number of points of essentia you invest in your kraken mantle. In addition, with a successful grapple check, you deal 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage plus your Strength modifier (or 1d6 points if you are Small) to your opponent. Chakra Bind (Totem) Your eyes grow large, with enormous pupils ringed with red, resembling the staring eyes of a kraken. You can breathe water or air equally well, as if you were constantly under the effect of a water breathing spell.

Krenshar Mask	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Krenshar Mask				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You form incarnum into a snarling, bestial mask of exposed bone and muscle. Its basic form is somewhere between that of a large cat and a wolf, but it lacks skin, showing sharp teeth, white bone, and pink-red muscles. The krenshar is an embodiment of nightmare. Totemists revere it as an agile hunter capable of making great leaps, stalking with stealth, and inspiring fear. While wearing your krenshar mask, you gain a +4 competence bonus on Jump and Move Silently checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your krenshar mask increases your competence bonus on Jump and Move Silently checks by 2. Chakra Bind (Brow) Your eyes stare forth from your krenshar mask, taking on a green-blue color. The jaws of the mask move as you speak, its muscles flexing weirdly in full view-an intimidating effect, to say the least. As a result of the mask's frightful appearance, you gain a competence bonus on Intimidate checks equal to the bonus the mask gives on Jump and Move Silently checks. Chakra Bind (Totem) Your face becomes one with your krenshar mask, so all its muscles move to match your expressions. A ridge of skin around the edge of the mask quivers when you grow angry or enter combat, and a growling edge creeps into your voice. You gain the ability to produce a loud screech (as a standard action) similar to that of a krenshar. In combination with the frightening aspect of the mask, this shriek causes one creature within 30 feet of you to become frightened for 1 round if it fails a Will save. (The creature must also be able to see you.) This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect.

Kruthik Claws	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Kruthik Claws				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraHands.ChakraShoulders.ChakraTotem	PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:Incarnum forms chitinous plates that hover over your shoulders and down your arms to your hands. At the backs of your hands, these plates take on long, triangular shapes like the scythe-claws of a kruthik, though these blades extend only barely beyond your fingertips. Kruthiks (described in the Miniatures Handbook) are vicious predators distinguished by their incredible agility. Totemists shape this soulmeld to claim a portion of that agility, as well as the acidic secretions and acid resistance possessed by fully mature kruthiks. With kruthik claws shaped, you gain a +4 competence bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your kruthik claws, your competence bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks increases by 2. Chakra Bind (Hands) The chitinous blades merge into the backs of your hands and sprout numerous sharp spines near your wrists. A sense of quickness dances in your fingers. You gain the benefit of the Weapon Finesse feat when attacking with natural weapons. Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Chitin plates fuse to your shoulders and grow thick and hard. Additional plates spread across your back, rising in a crest over your shoulders. You gain resistance to acid 10. Every point of essentia invested in your kruthik claws increases this resistance by 5 points. Chakra Bind (Totem) Enormous, serrated, scythelike claws extend from your wrists to cover your hands. Vicious spikes emerge from the base of these blades, and a bright blue acidic secretion lines the cutting edge. You can use your two claws as natural weapons that deal 1d6 points of damage plus your Strength modifier. For every point of essentia you invest in your kruthik claws, you deal an additional 1d4 points of acid damage with each claw attack. While the claws are shaped, you can still use your hands as normal (to hold items, cast spells, and so on), although you cannot hold an item in your hand and attack with the claws at the same time.

Lamia Belt	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Lamia Belt				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraWaist.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You form incarnum into a belt of golden-brown fur at your waist. If you touch it with your bare skin, you sometimes catch mental echoes of cruelty and anger. When you enter combat, some part of your mind is less interested in defeating your opponents than in causing them pain. Lamias are among the most humanlike of magical beasts, more similar to monstrous humanoids such as centaurs than to ankhegs or yrthaks. They are also evil and cruel, and it is hard to shape a lamia belt without being tainted by that evil. Totemists willing to take the risk hope to gain a lamia's gift for deception, as well as mimicking its four-legged form or its speed and agility in combat. While you wear your lamia belt, you gain a +4 competence bonus on Bluff and Hide checks. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your lamia belt, your competence bonus on Bluff and Hide checks increases by 2. Chakra Bind (Waist) Instead of a physical belt of fur, your lamia belt manifests as fur sprouting from your skin, from your waist down to your knees. Your legs also become slightly more muscular. You gain an enhancement bonus of +10 feet to your land speed, and you gain the benefit of the Spring Attack feat. Chakra Bind (Totem) The lower part of your body below your lamia belt takes on the shape of a lion, with four legs ending in sharp claws, a long, tufted tail, and coarse golden-brown fur. The upper portion of your body is unchanged, though perhaps a spark of evil grows stronger in your heart. Your leonine lower half is equipped with claws you can use as natural weapons. You can make two claw attacks as natural secondary attacks after attacking with a weapon or another natural attack (such as a bite). These attacks take a -5 penalty from your full base attack bonus and deal 1d4 points of damage.

Lammasu Mantle	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Lammasu Mantle				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraArms.ChakraShoulders.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Totemist=1			DESC:You form incarnum into a mantle of fur and feathers, shining golden brown around your shoulders and back. The cloak hangs down to your knees in back and wraps comfortably around your body to close in the front, if you wish. It is quite warm in cold weather, but not too hot in warmer temperatures. Wearing it makes you feel noble and righteous. Lammasus are noble creatures, sometimes called the archons of the natural world. Totemists of lawful good alignment hold them up as the ideal of perfection for magical beasts, to be emulated in every way possible. By shaping this soulmeld, totemists hope to claim their righteous protection from the touch of evil creatures. Your lammasu mantle protects you against the attacks of evil creatures. You gain a +2 deflection bonus to your Armor Class against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your lammasu mantle, you gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against the spells and effects used by evil creatures. Chakra Bind (Arms) The golden-brown fur of your mantle spreads down to your upper arms. At the same time, a palpable aura of goodness and power extends around you, cloaking your allies in the same protection the mantle gives you. The deflection and resistance bonuses granted by the lammasu mantle apply to all allies within 10 feet of you. Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Your lammasu mantle becomes one with your shoulders, and its feathers separate from its fur to form small, nonfunctional wings that spread behind you as if to ward off attackers. No summoned creatures except those of good alignment can approach within 10 feet of you (as the magic circle against evil spell). Chakra Bind (Totem) The golden-brown fur around your shoulders extends upward into an impressive mane around your head. There is a sensation in your mouth as if you were savoring a warm, sweet drink. You can breathe a 15-foot cone of fire as a standard action. Creatures within the area take 1d4 points of fire damage, plus 1d4 points of fire damage per point of invested essentia (Reflex half).

Landshark Boots	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Landshark Boots			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraFeet.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You shape incarnum into a pair of boots that resemble the heavy clawed feet of a bulette. Leathery skin encases your legs up to your knees, and enormous claws extend from the front of your feet. The bulette, also called the landshark, is closely associated with the earth in totemist traditions. Totemists channel the spirit energy of the bulette to attain connection with the earth-borrowing a measure of its tremorsense or its ability to burrow through the earth-as well as to mimic its fearsome qualities as a voracious predator. While wearing the landshark boots, you gain a +4 competence bonus on Jump checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in the landshark boots increases the competence bonus on Jump checks by 2. Chakra Bind (Feet) The leathery skin of your landshark boots extends up to the middle of your thighs, and your legs thicken and grow stronger. The boots transmit vibrations from the earth into your feet, allowing you to sense the movement of nearby creatures. As long as you are touching the ground, you can take a move action to sense the number of creatures within 10 feet that are also touching the ground and the direction to each one. You cannot pinpoint the location of any creature with this ability. Every point of essentia you invest in your landshark boots extends the range of your limited tremorsense by 5 feet. Chakra Bind (Totem) Your hands as well as your feet gain the heavy claws of a bulette, including one prominent central claw and two smaller claws on the sides. These massive claws emerge from the backs of your hands so you can bring them to bear while making a fist. You can use the claws on your hands as natural weapons that deal 1d6 points of damage. You cannot use a shield while these claws are in place. For every point of essentia you invest in your landshark boots, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with these claws. If, as part of a move, you achieve a Jump check result good enough to make a 5-foot high jump while within reach of an opponent, you can attack that opponent with all four claws as a standard action. You use the same attack bonus for all four attacks. You cannot make any other attacks in the same round, whether from natural weapons or manufactured weapons. The claws do not prevent you from using your hands normally or even binding another soulmeld to your hands chakra. However, you cannot hold an item in your hand and attack with your claws at the same time.

Lifebond Vestments	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Lifebond Vestments			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraArms.ChakraHeart				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:You shape incarnum into a fine, long-sleeved robe. It is a solid color-silver if you are good, gray if you are evil, red if you are lawful, or green if you are chaotic-but raw incarnum dances like elegant embroidery at the ends of the sleeves and the hem by your feet. If the soul is the animating force of a living creature, then incarnum might be seen as the essence of life itself. Incarnates who shape lifebond vestments embrace that concept of incarnum and wield it as a healing power, similar to positive energy. While wearing the lifebond vestments, you can channel your own life force to heal others. By laying your hands upon a living creature (a standard action), you heal a chosen amount of damage in the touched creature up to a maximum of 1 hit point per meldshaper level. At the same time, you take damage equal to one-half the amount healed (round fractions up). You may not use this ability on any creature more than once per hour. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your lifebond vestments adds 5 hit points to the limit of healing you can bestow when using the vestments. Chakra Bind (Arms) The sleeves of your lifebond vestments clasp tightly around your wrists, bound there by glowing rings of blue incarnum. Every wave of your hands sends shimmering blue sparks into the air. You can bestow healing upon a creature up to 30 feet away, instead of by touch. Chakra Bind (Heart) Additional embroidered designs, formed not of thread but of incarnum, appear down the front of your lifebond vestments, glowing brightly when you use the powers of the vestments but otherwise appearing simply decorative. You can bestow healing at will on any given creature.

Lightning Gauntlets	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Lightning Gauntlets			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraHands				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:Incarnum forms into a pair of metallic gloves that hover around your hands and any other gloves or gauntlets you wear. Blue arcs of electricity crackle between the fingers and spark between the gloves when you bring your hands close to each other. N!doka the North Star, a good incarnate of recent times, is said to have earned her sobriquet through the use of this soulmeld, creating such a bright flare of electrical power in a battle with a beholder that her allies were able to locate her by following the glow on the horizon. While wearing lightning gauntlets, you can deal 1d6 points of electricity damage with a successful melee touch attack (a standard action). Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your lightning gauntlets increases the damage dealt by 1d6 points. Chakra Bind (Hands) Your lightning gauntlets settle firmly around your hands. When you grip a weapon, electricity courses up its length and crackles at its tip. A lingering scent of ozone clings to you. You can add the electricity damage dealt by lightning gauntlets to one attack per round made with a handheld weapon, unarmed strike, or any natural attack using your hands (such as a slam or claw), but this requires a normal melee attack rather than a touch attack. You must announce that you are using the lightning gauntlets before making the attack; if you miss, you can't use them again until your next turn.

With a flash, the dice disappear a moment after they stop rolling, and you sense that your luck is changing. The dice are a metaphor, a physical representation of the forces of luck-good luck, in this case. They draw upon favorable spirit energy to grant you a small boon. You can use your lucky dice as a swift action, choosing an aspect of yourself to which to apply extra luck. You gain a +1 luck bonus on one of the following, at your option: attack rolls and damage rolls, saving throws, or skill and ability checks. This bonus lasts until the start of your next turn. When using this meld, roll 2d6. If the result is any combination of numbers that add up to 7, the luck bonus applies to all of the listed types of rolls. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in the lucky dice at the time you activate its special ability increases the duration of the luck bonus by 1 round. Because lucky dice can be rolled every round, it's possible for the soulmeld to provide bonuses to more than one type of check during a given round. Chakra Bind (Hands) Your comrades fight better when luck is on their side. Your lucky dice provide their bonus to all allies who are within 30 feet of you when you gain the bonus.

With this soulmeld, you summon forth soul energy from generations of wizards to grant you powers of acuity and magical aptitude. While you wear the mage's spectacles, you gain a +4 insight bonus on Decipher Script, Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device checks. The mage's spectacles also allow you to make these checks untrained. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your mage's spectacles increases the insight bonus granted to the listed skill checks by 2. Chakra Bind (Brow) Instead of spectacles perched on your nose, your mage's spectacles manifest as a third eye embedded in your forehead, its iris a rich azure.

Manticore Belt	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Manticore Belt				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraWaist.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:Incarnum forms a belt of spotted fur around your waist. At your back, short spines emerge from the belt. You note a marked increase in your appetite while you wear the belt. Manticores are fierce hunters that possess a unique ranged attack. Even totemists who do not share the manticore's evil bent shape this meld to gain a reliable way of attacking foes from a distance, not to mention the power of flight. While wearing your manticore belt, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus on Jump and Spot checks. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your manticore belt, your enhancement bonus on Jump and Spot checks increases by 2. Chakra Bind (Waist) Your manticore belt sprouts a pair of large, draconic wings. Though they are perched at your waist and flap awkwardly, these wings give you a reasonable ability of flight. You can fly with clumsy maneuverability at a speed of 10 feet per point of essentia invested in your manticore belt. You gain the Flyby Attack feat (see page 303 of the Monster Manual). Chakra Bind (Totem) A long, thick tail emerges from the back of your manticore belt, writhing and lashing at your command. At its tip is a cluster of spikes. Like a manticore, you can propel those spikes at your foes. As a standard action, you can snap your tail to loose a volley of spikes equal to the number of points of essentia you invest in your manticore belt. This attack has a range increment of 30 feet and a maximum range of 150 feet. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. Make a ranged attack roll for each spike using your full base attack bonus. A successful hit deals 1d6 points of damage plus one-half your Strength modifier.

Mantle Of Flame	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Mantle Of Flame			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraShoulders				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:You shape incarnum into a cloak of wispy blue flame. The cloak covers your arms and almost closes in front of you, where a band of fire crosses over your heart to connect the cloak's two edges. The fire does not harm you, though it keeps you as warm and dry as any heavy cloak in cold or rainy weather. A thirst for vengeance burns like fire in many souls, and a mantle of flame gives that metaphor literal truth: vengeance turned to flame. While you wear your mantle of flame, any creature that strikes you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time, the attacker takes 1d6 points of fire damage. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach, such as long spears, are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The mantle of flame grants shadowy illumination in your space, but provides no further lighting. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your mantle of flame increases the damage dealt by 1d6 points. Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Your mantle of flame burns particularly brightly around your shoulders, forming a high collar behind your head and neck. As a standard action, you can briefly expand the mantle of flame to encompass all adjacent squares. Any creatures in those squares take damage as if they had attacked you with a handheld weapon (Reflex half). The mantle of flame then returns to its normal effect.

Mauling Gauntlets	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Mauling Gauntlets			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraArms.ChakraHands				PRECLASS:1,Soulborn=1					DESC:Incarnum forms gauntlets that surround your hands (including any gloves or gauntlets you already wear) and extend up your arms to your elbows. The metal gleams a burnished blue. Spikes and blades jut out in various places from these gauntlets, each one whispering an ancient battle cry in your mind. Mauling gauntlets are said to channel the fierce power of warriors throughout history. While wearing mauling gauntlets, you gain a +2 morale bonus on Strength checks (but not on Strength-based skill checks), such as those to break down doors or to bull rush an opponent. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your mauling gauntlets increases the morale bonus by 2. Chakra Bind (Arms) Your mauling gauntlets extend winding bands of blue steel up past your elbows, almost to your shoulders. In places, these bands of metal seem fused with your skin. Your mauling gauntlets double the critical threat range of any melee weapon you wield. This does not stack with any other effect that increases a weapon's threat range, such as the Improved Critical feat or the keen weapon special quality. Chakra Bind (Hands) Rather than actual gauntlets, this soulmeld transforms your hands into hard blue metal. Whenever you bend your fingers, echoes of the battlefield flit through your mind, until they form a constant undertone of war chants and battle cries inspiring you to greater accomplishments in battle. You gain a morale bonus on unarmed strike damage equal to the morale bonus on Strength checks granted by the mauling gauntlets. You also gain the benefit of the Improved Unarmed Strike feat.

Necrocarnum Circlet	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Necrocarnum Circlet			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraCrown				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:Necrocarnum bends itself into a matte black crown that seems to consume light. The fractured remnants of souls broken by the power of necrocarnum float within this soulmeld. These forms barely surface in this dark and foreboding crown, yet even the faintest glimpse is unsettling. You form necrocarnum into a dark circlet that rests on your head like a crown. The circlet allows you to detect nearby undead, bolster their turn resistance, and even animate a necrocarnum zombie. While this soulmeld is shaped, you unerringly detect the presence and position of undead creatures within 30 feet. This ability functions like the blindsight ability, except that it detects only undead creatures. Essentia: Undead within a 30-foot radius gain turn resistance equal to the number of points of essentia that you invest in the soulmeld. If you animated the undead, the turn resistance is equal to double the number of points of invested essentia. Chakra Bind (Crown) A matching coil of necrocarnum forms around the head of a corpse. Filled with the dark power of necrocarnum, the corpse shambles to its feet, its flesh and mind overtaken by the curse of undeath. A necrocarnum zombie resembles a shambling corpse with black motes of light slowly swimming under its rotting skin. When you shape this soulmeld and bind it to your crown chakra, you can cause it to animate a corpse within 30 feet as a necrocarnum zombie (see page 186). The affected creature's Hit Dice cannot exceed your meldshaper level. This requires a full-round action and provokes attacks of opportunity; in addition, you take damage equal to the necrocarnum zombie's Hit Dice, which may not be healed as long as the zombie remains animated. As long as you have essentia invested in the soulmeld, the necrocarnum zombie's essentia pool is increased by the same quantity. The animated zombie can act immediately on your turn. You have complete control over the zombie as long as you maintain line of effect. Should this line of effect be broken, the zombie acts on its own accord to carry out your last instructions. You reestablish control as soon as you reestablish line of effect. You can have only one necrocarnum zombie animated at any given time. Animating a second turns the original into an inert corpse. If this soulmeld is unshaped, any necrocarnum zombie created by it returns to an inert corpse. No creature can be affected by the necrocarnum circlet more than once.

Necrocarnum Mantle	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Necrocarnum Mantle			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraThroat				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:A long cloak of shifting shadow drapes from your shoulders and down your back. Faint forms seem to swim in the depths of this shadow, tortured and twisted shapes that once might have been human. These apparitions writhe and buckle, wracked by incomprehensible agony. Their tortured, elongated faces hold their gaping mouths open in soundless eternal screams. You form a cloak of necrocarnum that surrounds you with necromantic energy. Meldshapers who take the time to explain their use of such evil energies declare that the cloak's protective qualities suggest that necrocarnum is not a source of evil as others suggest, ignoring the fact that these protective qualities resemble and exemplify the traits of unlife. While you have a necrocarnum mantle shaped, you gain immunity to disease. Shaping the mantle does not affect any disease that you might already have. Essentia: As you invest essentia in the necrocarnum mantle, necrocarnum floods through your mind, granting you the ability to shake off mental effects. For every point of essentia you invest in your necrocarnum mantle, you gain a +1 profane bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. Chakra Bind (Throat) The shadowy mantle clings tightly to your throat, drawing your features further into darkness. At the same time, the shadows of the cloak seem longer, spreading over a wider area and shifting at the touch of some foul, unseen breeze. As long as the necrocarnum mantle is bound to your throat chakra, you gain immunity to poison.

Necrocarnum Shroud	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Necrocarnum Shroud			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraSoul.ChakraWaist				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:A deadening field of necrocarnum radiates from you, filling the air around you with faint, shadowy tendrils. You force necrocarnum to shape a life-draining field around you. While you have the necrocarnum shroud shaped, you gain a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls any time a living creature takes damage while adjacent to you. This bonus lasts for 1 round. If a living creature dies while adjacent to you, the bonus instead lasts for a number of rounds equal to the creature's Hit Dice. Essentia: If you invest essentia in the necrocarnum shroud, the area encompassed by the life-draining field expands. Any living creature who takes damage (or dies) within 5 feet plus 5 feet per point of essentia invested triggers the bonus. (For example, if you've invested 2 points of essentia, you would gain the bonus for any living creature taking damage or dying within 15 feet of you.) Chakra Bind (Soul) Necrocarnum laces through your very being, turning your skin a light-eating matte black. Even more unsettling than your skin color, your eyes turn a deep and lusterless black as well, devoid of iris, pupil, or white. While you have necrocarnum shroud bound to your soul chakra, you can take a standard action to strike a living foe with the raw evil of necrocarnum. When you use this ability, you must make a successful melee touch attack against the intended victim. If successful, your touch bestows 1d4 negative levels on the target (Fortitude half). For each negative level bestowed, you gain 1 temporary point of essentia and 5 temporary hit points. The temporary essentia lasts until the end of your next turn. The temporary hit points fade after 1 hour. Chakra Bind (Waist) The shadowy tendrils of necrocarnum that surround you seem to reach out toward nearby creatures. These faint touches of necrocarnum instill terror into many creatures, affecting their ability to fight. At the beginning of your turn, any creature within the area of your life-draining field becomes shaken for 1 round (Will negates).

Necrocarnum Touch	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Necrocarnum Touch			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraArms				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:Jet black shadows wreathe your hands and forearms, coiling and twisting with a life of their own. These insubstantial coils of energy hint at evil and agony, seeming to draw light and hope out of the surrounding area. You call upon dark powers to twist and torture the soul energy that is incarnum. The result, a cloying, sickly energy of great evil, twines itself around your hands and arms, allowing you to disguise some of your movements, draw the life force directly from living creatures, or even fill the air with bolts of pure necrocarnum. The coiling energy makes the movements of your hands and arms hard to follow. While you have necrocarnum touch shaped, you gain a +4 profane bonus on Sleight of Hand checks (as well as the ability to use the skill untrained) and on Bluff checks made to feint in combat. Essentia: Whenever you invest essentia in necrocarnum touch, you can use the dark energy to inflict damage on living creatures. You can make a melee touch attack as a standard action. This attack deals 1d8 points of damage for every point of essentia that you invest in the soulmeld, but only on living creatures (Fortitude half). Chakra Bind (Arms) The shadowy strands of evil that twine about your hands and arms elongate, trailing tendrils of shadow into the area immediately around you. When you clench your fists, this shadow gathers, and you can release this energy in dark bolts of necrocarnum. While necrocarnum touch is bound to your arms chakra, you can fire a ray of pure necrocarnum as a standard action. This ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and has a range of 30 feet. If it strikes a living creature, it deals 1d8 points of damage for every point of essentia that you invest in the soulmeld (Fortitude half ).

Necrocarnum Vestments	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Necrocarnum Vestments		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraHeart.ChakraWaist				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:Necrocarnum twists and writhes into the shape of long, flowing vestments. These vestments cling tightly to your shoulders, but drape loosely over the rest of your body, obscuring other garments behind an ever-shifting screen of terror. As with all necrocarnum melds, faint forms seem to swim in the depths of this shadowy vestment. These tortured apparitions seem wracked by incomprehensible agony, their elongated faces wrenched open in eternal screams. Necrocarnum vestments bind necrocarnum into a shadowy robe. This strange soulmeld deadens both flesh and spirit, granting you a resistance to cold as well as an unholy ability to withstand physical blows. When bound closer to your spirit, the vestments can shed a radius of killing frost or even shield you from deadly necromantic effects. When you have necrocarnum vestments shaped, you gain resistance to cold 5 as the energies of necrocarnum deaden your flesh to the effects of cold. Essentia: For every point of essentia invested in the necrocarnum vestments, you gain 3 bonus hit points. These are not temporary hit points and are not depleted first as are temporary hit points. You can render yourself staggered, unconscious, or even dead by changing the quantity of essentia invested in this soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Heart) Black necrocarnum energy coalesces around your heart. This effect is usually covered by clothing or armor, but anyone viewing the skin of your chest sees coils of dark energy swirling beneath the surface, as if your skin were a portal to a forgotten maelstrom of evil. When you have necrocarnum vestments bound to your heart chakra, you are immune to stunning and death effects. Chakra Bind (Waist) Necrocarnum binds to your flesh, sheathing you in a sinister web of energy. The necrocarnum pulses with the chill touch of pure evil, spreading a deadening cold to nearby creatures. When you have necrocarnum vestments bound to your waist chakra, any living creature adjacent to you at the end of your turn takes 1d6 points of cold damage (Fortitude negates).

Necrocarnum Weapon	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Necrocarnum Weapon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraHands				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:Shadowy threads of necrocarnum bind to your melee weapon. This dark energy seems to ripple beneath the surface of the weapon, pulsing irregularly from your hands to the tip of the weapon and back again. You bind the taint of necrocarnum to a melee weapon. The energies enable you to penetrate the damage of some goodaligned creatures, deal extra damage with the weapon, and even strike directly at the soul energy of those you hit. When you shape this soulmeld, choose a melee weapon that you hold. As long as the soulmeld is shaped, the weapon bypasses damage reduction as if it were evil-aligned. The soulmeld remains shaped if you put the weapon down or if another creature wields it, but other creatures do not benefit from any of the soulmeld's effects, including the benefits of essentia investment or binding it to a chakra. The weapon suffers no ill effects from shaping or unshaping the soulmeld. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your necrocarnum weapon, you gain a +1 profane bonus on damage rolls and on attack rolls made to confirm a critical threat. Both of these bonuses apply only when the weapon is used against a living creature. Chakra Bind (Hands) When you strike a living creature in a particularly vulnerable area, necrocarnum floods from your weapon into the victim. At the same time, pure blue soul energy, incarnum unsullied by the taint of necrocarnum, flows into you, granting you a temporary increase in power. When you have a necrocarnum weapon soulmeld bound to your hands chakra and you successfully make a critical hit with the weapon on a living creature, you gain temporary essentia equal to the number of points of essentia invested in this soulmeld. You can use this essentia normally, but it fades after 10 rounds. (Multiple uses of this ability don't stack.) This ability works normally for critical hits delivered when making a coup de grace attack.

Pauldrons Of Health	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Pauldrons Of Health			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraShoulders				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:Incarnum shapes heavy plates of armor that hover above your shoulders. They seem formed of pearly white alabaster except for a thin band of runic carvings etched in midnight blue. The essential nature of incarnum is to provide life and health to mortal bodies, since it is made of the energy of souls. Pauldrons of health distill that quality to ward you against effects targeting your vitality or health. While wearing pauldrons of health, you are immune to disease, as well as being sickened or nauseated (as the conditions in the Dungeon Master's Guide). Essentia: You gain an enhancement bonus on Fortitude saves equal to the number of points of essentia you invest in your pauldrons of health. Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Settled directly on your shoulders, your incarnate pauldrons glow with a faint but vibrant silver-blue energy. In the immediate presence of the undead, they glow a little brighter, and if you are subjected to an energy drain attack, they momentarily flare to brilliant intensity as the attack dissipates. You gain immunity to energy drain.

Pegasus Cloak	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Pegasus Cloak				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraShoulders.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You shape an elegant cloak, seemingly made of feathers and pure radiance. A thing of great beauty and delicacy, it evokes thoughts of a pair of beautiful white wings. Majestic horses of the skies, pegasi are naturally associated with the air and with flight. Totemists shape this soulmeld to claim their mastery of the air, and eventually to gain true f light. While wearing the pegasus cloak, you gain the effect of a feather fall spell at all times. You also gain a +2 enhancement bonus on Jump checks, since the winglike cloak provides a slight boost to your leaps. Essentia: Your enhancement bonus on Jump checks increases by 2 for every point of essentia you invest in your pegasus cloak. Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Even as your shoulders take on the cloudy white color of a pegasus' coat, your pegasus cloak forms into two distinct wings that you can use to achieve true flight. You can extend the feathers of the cloak to form a great pair of birdlike wings. This allows you to fly (average maneuverability) at a speed of 10 feet per point of essentia you invest in your pegasus cloak. Chakra Bind (Totem) Even as the feathers of your pegasus cloak extend up the back of your neck and head to suggest a white, feathery mane, the cloak itself forms into two distinct wings that you can use to achieve limited flight. You can extend the feathers of the cloak to form a great pair of birdlike wings, allowing limited flight capability. This grants you the ability to fly (average maneuverability) a short distance as a move action. You can fly up to 10 feet per point of essentia you invest in your pegasus cloak, though you must begin and end each such move on a solid surface or you'll fall.

Phase Cloak	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Phase Cloak				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraShoulders.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You form incarnum into a gray and white cloak with mottled blue markings that seems to shift and flow over your back like liquid. Phase spiders are magical beasts that resemble spiders, and they represent all of spiderkind in totemist thinking. They are associated with mobility of all sorts, from their ability to climb walls to their ethereal phasing power. You gain a +4 competence bonus on Climb checks. In addition, you can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened, and you retain your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class while climbing. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your phase cloak, your competence bonus on Climb checks increases by 2. Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Your phase cloak becomes even more like a silvery gray liquid, seeming to flow like a gentle stream even when completely motionless. Its mottled blue markings also extend to the skin of your shoulders and upper torso. When you use a move action to move at least 5 feet, you can become ethereal during the movement. Among other effects, this means that you can cross difficult terrain without penalty and even pass through walls. While moving, you are not subject to attacks of opportunity except from creatures that can see into the Ethereal Plane and affect ethereal creatures. However, you become material after each move. Thus, if you perform a double move, you must end your first move in a space where you can return to the Material Plane before becoming ethereal again for the second part of your move. If you are within a solid object when your etherealness ends, you are immediately shunted to the nearest open space, taking 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet that you so travel. While using this ability, you are subject to possible attack by creatures on the Ethereal Plane. As a general guideline, the DM should roll once on the Ethereal Plane Encounters table (page 152 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) for each encounter during which you use this ability, with a result of 01-80 indicating that no danger lurks on the Ethereal Plane in that location. Chakra Bind (Totem) A terrible spidery head extends like a hood from your phase cloak, covering your face. Eight silver-white eyes set in dark blue chitin cover your own eyes, and a huge pair of fangs dripping poison covers your mouth. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage and injects a mild poison (Fortitude negates, initial damage 1d3 Con, secondary damage none). You can use this bite either as a primary attack (in which case it uses your full base attack bonus and adds your Strength bonus on damage rolls) or as a secondary attack (with a -5 penalty on the attack roll and applying only half your Strength bonus on your damage roll). Every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld grants a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls made with the bite attack.

Phoenix Belt	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Phoenix Belt				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraWaist.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You shape a belt made of feathers the color of flame-various reds, oranges, and yellows. The feathers seem to shift in color, pulsing softly, like the embers of a dying fire. Totemists revere phoenixes as divine creatures or at least the messengers of the gods, and in channeling their power for soulmelds they hope to lay claim to power that is nearly divine. Phoenixes are primarily associated with fire, but their effective immortality gives them associations with protection and rebirth as well. This soulmeld is most popular among totemists native to hot desert and jungle lands. Your phoenix belt protects you from harm in hot environments. You can exist comfortably in conditions between 40 and 140? Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves. Your equipment is likewise protected. The phoenix is a magical beast detailed in Monster Manual II. Essentia: If you invest essentia in your phoenix belt, it also protects you from fire damage. You gain resistance to fire equal to 5 times the number of points of essentia you invest in this soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Waist) You have a very palpable sense of fire burning within you, but in a pleasant, comforting way, much like a heated stone warming a cold bed at night. When subjected to fire damage, the feathers of your phoenix belt flare up briefly, as coals fanned by a breeze. You can turn fire damage into fast healing. Whenever your resistance to fire (whether from this soulmeld or another source) reduces the damage dealt to you by a fire-based attack, you gain fast healing 1 for a number of rounds equal to the amount of damage negated by your resistance. For example, if you were hit with a fireball for 22 points of damage and had resistance to fire 10, you would gain fast healing 1 for 10 rounds (since your resistance negated 10 points of damage). If instead you were hit with burning hands for 6 points of damage, you would gain fast healing 1 for only 6 rounds (since your resistance negated only 6 points of damage). The fast healing granted by this chakra bind doesn't stack with itself (or with any other kind of fast healing). If this chakra bind would grant you fast healing from a second source of fire damage, use only the longer remaining duration. Chakra Bind (Totem) Now it is no longer just the feathers in your phoenix belt that seem to glow like hot coals, but your eyes and, to an extent, your skin as well. Your eyes burn red, and your skin gives off a soft heat like a warm hearth. With a moment's concentrated effort, however, that fire can be made real around you, and quite painful to those who threaten you. As a standard action, you can create a momentary ring of fire that surrounds you. Creatures adjacent to you take 1d6 points of fire damage per point of essentia you invest in your phoenix belt. A successful Reflex save reduces this damage by half.

Planar Chasuble	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Planar Chasuble			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow.ChakraSoul				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:Incarnum forms an ornate vestment draped over your shoulders, covering any other clothing, armor, or vestments you are wearing. The chasuble is little more than a large circle with a hole in the center for your head, but raw incarnum is woven like blue thread into intricate patterns down its front. The planar chasuble binds the raw material of another plane to the garment and infuses it with power. When you wear the chasuble, you are considered a native on any plane with an alignment trait matching your chosen alignment (and gain the extraplanar subtype while on the Material Plane). While on such a plane, you ignore the effect of any alignment traits of the plane (see page 149 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). For example, a lawful incarnate who shapes this soulmeld would be considered native to any plane with the lawful trait, including the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia and the Nine Hells of Baator. You also gain resistance 10 to a specific energy type, based on your alignment. Chaotic incarnates gain resistance to electricity 10, evil incarnates gain resistance to acid 10, good incarnates gain resistance to cold 10, and lawful incarnates gain resistance to fire 10. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in your planar chasuble increases the resistance to the specified energy type by 5 points. Chakra Bind (Brow) When you activate your incarnum radiance, the glow surrounding you also courses through the incarnum threads in your planar chasuble. The bonus granted by your incarnum radiance class feature increases by 1. Chakra Bind (Soul) The embroidered patterns formed by raw incarnum in the front of your planar chasuble constantly shift and seem to depict living scenes from planes beyond the material world. Once per week you can open a gate, as the spell, to any plane with an alignment trait matching your chosen alignment. Each gate you open costs 1,000 XP if you use the "calling creatures" function.

Planar Ward	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Planar Ward				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraThroat				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:You shape incarnum into an amulet bound tight to your throat by a slender blue chain. The amulet itself resembles a large blue sapphire carved into the shape of a scarab beetle holding a solar disk between its front legs. The planar ward soulmeld duplicates some of the effects of spells such as protection from evil and dismissal, but incarnates through the ages have argued that the soulmeld is actually the earlier form of this warding magic. In fact, some have argued that planar ward was the first soulmeld ever shaped, long before the principles of incarnum were fully understood, as the ancestors of the humanoid races sought protection from forces greater than themselves. Your planar ward protects you from mental control. It blocks any attempt to possess you (by a magic jar attack, for example) or exercise mental control over you, including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over you. The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting you, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the planar ward's effect. If you were to unshape your planar ward while the effect granting mental control continued, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command you. Likewise, the planar ward keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the soulmeld is shaped. Essentia: The planar ward provides a morale bonus on saves made to resist the supernatural or spell-like abilities of extraplanar creatures. The bonus is equal to the number of points of essentia invested in the soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Throat) Your planar ward takes the form of a glowing blue orb embedded in the base of your throat. When an extraplanar creature strikes you, the orb flares with blue light, enveloping the attacker for an instant. You can drive an extraplanar creature back to its home plane. Whenever you are struck by an extraplanar creature, the attacking creature must succeed on a Will save or be driven back to its home plane. The creature adds its Hit Dice as a bonus on its saving throw, and you add your meldshaper level to the planar ward's save DC.

Rageclaws	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Rageclaws				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraHands.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You form incarnum into a pair of furred gloves tipped with short claws. These gloves fit over your hands as well as any other gloves or gauntlets you might wear. When you clench your hands into fists, you can feel a surge of anger and determination well up inside you. The rageclaws soulmeld makes no attempt to channel soul energy from any particular kind of magical beast. Rather, it taps into the primal rage and survival instinct shared by all creatures of that type, a powerful will to survive and prevail. Totemists typically shape this meld when they expect to face overwhelming odds, but some totemists shape it simply to gain courage and fury in battle. While you wear your rageclaws, you can continue to fight without penalty if you are disabled or dying. When reduced to 0 hit points, you can act as if you weren't disabled (that is, you ignore the normal restriction to only a single move or standard action per turn). You do not lose 1 hit point for performing a standard or otherwise strenuous action while at 0 hit points. When reduced to -1 to -9 hit points, you do not fall unconscious. You do not automatically lose 1 hit point each round when at -1 to -9 hit points. When your current hit points drop to -10 or lower, you immediately die. Essentia: Investing essentia in rageclaws increases the range of negative hit points at which you can continue functioning. Every point of essentia invested effectively reduces the point at which you die by 3 (such as from -10 to -13). You can continue to fight without penalty until you reach that hit point total. If your essentia investment in this soulmeld is reduced (whether voluntarily or involuntarily) and your current hit point total is at or below the point at which you would die, you immediately die. For example, if you are currently at -16 hit points and reduce your essentia investment from 3 points to 2 points, you would die (since your new point of death would be -16). Chakra Bind (Hands) The fur of your rageclaws merges into your hands, and your fingers become tipped with small, dark claws instead of nails. Each blow that lands on your body causes a blood rage to swell up in you, building until you are near death and then erupting in desperate fury. While your hit point total is below 0, you gain a +2 morale bonus on melee attack rolls, melee weapon damage rolls, and Fortitude saves. Though similar in some ways to a barbarian's rage, this state applies no restriction on what actions you can take. Chakra Bind (Totem) The fur of your rageclaws merges into your hands, and your fingers become tipped with long, sharp claws you can use to tear the flesh of your foes. You can use your rageclaws as a pair of natural weapons that deal 1d6 points of damage plus your Strength modifier. When you grapple an opponent, you can attack with both claws; these attacks are not subject to the usual -4 penalty for attacking with a natural weapon in a grapple. While the rageclaws are shaped, you can still use your hands as normal (to hold items, cast spells, and so on), although you cannot hold an item in your hand and attack with the claws at the same time. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with your claws for every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld.

Riding Bracers	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Riding Bracers				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraArms.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1,Totemist=1	DESC:You form incarnum into a pair of hard leather bracers that encircle your wrists. They smell noticeably of horse and hay. Humanoids have ridden horses into battle for ages, and by channeling the soul energy of these mounted warriors-and their steeds-you increase your own skill at mounted combat. Wearing the riding bracers grants you a +4 insight bonus on Handle Animal and Ride checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in the riding bracers increases the insight bonus on Handle Animal and Ride checks by 2. Chakra Bind (Arms) Your riding bracers clench tight around your wrists. When you mount a steed, your bracers almost seem to guide your hands on the reins. When you draw a weapon while mounted, you, your mount, and your weapon all seem to move in a coordinated, deadly dance. When mounted, you gain a +2 insight bonus on melee damage rolls and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class. Chakra Bind (Totem) There is no change in the appearance of your riding bracers, but when you mount a steed, you feel a close connection with the animal. It almost seems to respond to your mental commands as much as to your hands on the reins. If you are riding an animal, or a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, you can handle the creature as a free action or push it as a move action, even if you don't have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. In addition, your mount gains evasion, as the rogue class feature described on page 50 of the Player's Handbook.

Sailor's Bracers	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Sailor's Bracers			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraArms				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:Incarnum forms a pair of leather bands surrounding your wrists (and any other bracers or bracelets you might wear). When you are still and your eyes are closed, you feel a gentle rocking as if you were aboard a ship on a calm sea. You call upon the talents of generations of seafaring men and women to increase your proficiency at the work of sailing. Shaping sailor's bracers makes the sea your home. While you wear your sailor's bracers, you gain a +4 insight bonus on Swim, Profession (sailor), and Use Rope checks. This soulmeld also lets you make Profession (sailor) checks untrained. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your sailor's bracers increases the insight bonus by 2. Chakra Bind (Arms) Instead of plain leather, your sailor's bracers seem formed of fish scales-and indeed, large fins sprout from their sides to help you swim. You can swim at up to your speed (as a full-round action) or up to half your speed (as a move action). You take no penalty on attack rolls made underwater (as if you had freedom of movement).

Shadow Mantle	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Shadow Mantle				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraShoulders.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:Incarnum forms a rough cloak of stony gray around your shoulders and back. As you move, the cloak writhes behind you, suggesting the movement of tentacles. It seems to collect shadow, always appearing darker than the surrounding area. The darkmantle is hardly the most fearsome of magical beasts, but its association with darkness and perception makes the soulmeld that channels its energy a powerful one. Totemists in subterranean cultures are particularly partial to the shadow mantle soulmeld. Channeling the merest suggestion of a darkmantle's powerful blindsight, you gain a +4 competence bonus on Listen checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your shadow mantle increases the competence bonus on Listen checks by 2. Chakra Bind (Shoulders) The shadows of your mantle deepen, and its coloration grows darker. Blackness seems to cling in every fold and sometimes trail off in wisps from the mantle's substance. You start to hear sounds too high for most humans to detect, and occasionally sounds too low, as well. As a swift action, you can surround yourself with a globe of magical darkness to a radius of 5 feet per point of invested essentia. You also gain blindsight with the same radius. Thus, you are completely aware of all creatures within the radius of darkness, but you are invisible to them unless they have some way of piercing magical darkness. On the other hand, creatures beyond the radius of your darkness are invisible to you, but they can guess your location within the darkness. If you enter a zone of magical silence, your blindsight no longer functions. You can end the darkness effect as a swift action; ending the darkness effect also ends your blindsight. Chakra Bind (Totem) Your shadow mantle literally draws shadows to itself, and it changes color to match your surroundings. You find it much easier to hide from view by drawing the cloak around your body and ducking your head into its membranous collar. You gain a competence bonus on Hide checks equal to the bonus the soulmeld grants on Listen checks (+4 plus an additional +2 per point of invested essentia).

Shedu Crown	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Shedu Crown				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraCrown.ChakraHeart.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:Glowing argent incarnum forms a shining crown that hovers slightly above your head. Its presence lends a regal air to your bearing, and you feel yourself become more calm, more dignified, and more stable-emotionally and even physically grounded. A shedu (described in the Fiend Folio) is a noble beast related to the lammasu, distinguished by the crown it wears. With a human head atop the body of a five-legged bull, a shedu possesses a physical stability that reflects its moral purity and mental stamina as well. You are immune to being pushed back as the result of a bull rush, including the effects of spells such as Bigby's forceful hand and telekinesis (when used to perform a bull rush). Essentia: You gain a competence bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and effects equal to the number of points of essentia you invest in your shedu crown. Chakra Bind (Crown) Your shedu crown settles firmly on your head, but its appearance is otherwise unchanged. You can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time. This is a mind-affecting effect. Chakra Bind (Heart) The appearance of your shedu crown is unchanged, but when you use the power of this chakra bind, it briefly flares with brilliant silver light. You can shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane as a standard action and return to the Material Plane as a free action. Each day, you can spend a total number of rounds on the Ethereal Plane equal to your meldshaper level (each use counts as a minimum of 1 round). This ability otherwise functions as the ethereal jaunt spell. Chakra Bind (Totem) Your hair grows into a bushy mane beneath your crown. If you are male, your beard likewise grows. Your body looks and feels more solid and strong. You gain the ability to make a trample attack. As a full-round action, you can move up to twice your speed and literally run over any creature equal to your own size or smaller. You merely have to move over the opponents in your path; any creature whose space is completely covered by your space is subject to the trample attack. If a target's space is larger than 5 feet, it is considered trampled only if you move over all the squares it occupies. Your trample attack deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage (or 1d6 points if you are Small) plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier. If you are larger than Medium or smaller than Small, the damage scales up or down accordingly (see page 114 of the Player's Handbook). Trampled opponents can attempt attacks of opportunity, but these take a -4 penalty. (Opponents whose space is larger than 5 feet and whom you do not trample can also take attacks of opportunity at the same penalty.) An opponent can also give up its attack of opportunity and instead attempt a Reflex save to take half damage from your trample. You can deal trampling damage to each target only once per round, no matter how many times your movement takes you over a target creature.

Sighting Gloves	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Sighting Gloves			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraHands				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:Turquoise incarnum energy briefly forms a sheath around your hands before merging with your flesh. The energy steadies your hands so that when you launch an arrow or throw a weapon, it flies true, leaving blue-green sparks in its wake. You form incarnum into gloves of energy, which are absorbed into your skin after you fit them around your hands. The soulmeld draws upon the soul energy of legendary archers, improving your aim while giving you insightful hints regarding the best time to release an arrow, fire a bolt, or throw an axe. You gain a +1 insight bonus on damage rolls made with ranged weapons. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in sighting gloves increases the insight bonus by 1. Chakra Bind (Hands) Your grip on your ranged weapon is as light as can be, requiring only the slightest motion to release your arrow, pull the trigger of your crossbow, or deliver your throw. When you bind sighting gloves to your hands chakra, you can shoot or throw at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard -4 penalty on your attack roll, as if you had the Precise Shot feat.

Silvertongue Mask	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Silvertongue Mask			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow.ChakraThroat				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:A plain silver mask conceals your lower face while exposing your eyes. The mask is initially featureless, with a simple horizontal slot at your mouth, but subtle images shift across its surface as you interact with others. Silvertongue masks were used by some of the first incarnates to gain the favor of neighboring tribes and nations by providing familiar and comforting images to accompany diplomatic pleas. The soulmeld draws on the souls of quick-witted and slick-tongued heroes, helping to guide the meldshaper in beguilement or negotiation. You shape incarnum into a silver-blue mask that you wear over your face. Your silvertongue mask grants you a +2 insight bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your silvertongue mask increases the insight bonus by 2. Chakra Bind (Brow) Blue crystalline lenses grow out from the mask, covering your eyes. These lenses enhance your sensitivity to body language and mannerisms. You gain an insight bonus on Sense Motive checks equal to the bonus granted on Bluff and Diplomacy checks by the mask. Chakra Bind (Throat) The silver mask melds into your face and neck, from your cheekbones down to your collar, as if your skin were turned to silver. When you attempt to compel a creature, that creature sees a face that is recognizable, but not quite familiar. When bound to the throat chakra, the silvertongue mask allows you to make a suggestion (as the spell) to any creature as a standard action. A successful Will save negates this effect. A creature targeted by this ability, regardless of whether or not it succeeds on its save, can't be targeted again by the same ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting, languagedependent effect.

Soulspark Familiar	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Soulspark Familiar			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow.ChakraCrown.ChakraThroat				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:A spark of light hovers over your shoulder. While featureless, it seems to emote using its own brilliance, ranging from an angry burn to a contented glow. Soulspark familiars are nearly constant companions of some meldshapers, filling the role of a loyal defender, a confidant, a guard, or sometimes simply a light to show the way. You shape a small mote of soul energy called a least soulspark, which accompanies you and can attack your foes at your direction. The presence of the soulspark grants you the Alertness feat. The soulspark follows you, typically hovering near your shoulder. If the soulspark is more than 10 feet from you at the end of its turn, it unshapes. You can communicate empathically with the soulspark, and directing it to attack a creature is a free action. A soulspark familiar whose creator is incapable of issuing new directions follows its last command as long as it is able, after which it returns to hover over its creator. If the soulspark is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, the meld unshapes. The least soulspark is a new creature detailed on page 197. A soulspark formed by this soulmeld does not have the incarnum shroud ability normally possessed by such creatures, nor does it have an essentia pool. Essentia: When you allocate essentia to your soulspark familiar, you can select one of the following effects. All essentia invested must be put toward the same effect. Align Attack: The first point of essentia invested makes the soulspark's attack good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as you choose, allowing it to bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures, usually outsiders of the opposite alignment. Every point beyond the first grants the soulspark a +1 bonus on damage against any creature of the opposing alignment. Attack Bonus: Every point of essentia grants the soulspark a +1 bonus on its attack rolls and damage rolls. Deflection Bonus: Every point of essentia grants the soulspark a +1 deflection bonus to Armor Class. Healing: Every point of essentia invested grants the soulspark a certain amount of fast healing. A least soulspark gains fast healing equal to 1 ? the points of essentia invested, a lesser soulspark gains fast healing equal to 2 ? the points of essentia invested, a standard soulspark gains fast healing equal to 3 ? the points of essentia invested, and a greater soulspark gains fast healing equal to 4 ? the points of essentia invested. Saving Throw Bonus: Every point of essentia grants the soulspark a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. Chakra Bind (Brow) Your soulspark shimmers like the desert sky. If you bind soulspark familiar to your brow chakra, you create a standard soulspark. Chakra Bind (Crown) Your soulspark glows sapphire blue, like a brilliant gemstone. If you bind soulspark familiar to your crown chakra, you create a lesser soulspark. Chakra Bind (Throat) Your soulspark burns with a fierce blue-white light. If you bind soulspark familiar to your throat chakra, you create a greater soulspark.

Soulspeaker Circlet	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Soulspeaker Circlet			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraCrown.ChakraThroat				PRECLASS:1,Soulborn=1					DESC:A light blue circlet sits atop your head, with serrated points above each of your ears. A faint voice whispers in your mind, translating the words that you hear. This soulmeld draws on the linguistic talents of creatures living and dead to translate an unfamiliar language. Choose a language when you shape your soulspeaker circlet. While the soulmeld is shaped, you can understand the spoken forms of that language. This does not provide you the ability to speak, read, or write that language. Essentia: For every point of essentia invested in soulspeaker circlet, you can select an additional language that you understand. Chakra Bind (Crown) The circlet merges with your flesh, remaining visible as a band of blue across your forehead, similar to a tattoo. The whispers in your mind now translate your own thoughts, telling you the words you must speak to be understood. The soulspeaker circlet grants you the ability to speak those languages for which it grants understanding. You still cannot read or write these languages. Chakra Bind (Throat) The circlet extends tendrils that reach down your head to wrap around your neck. Your words can now be translated directly into thought. As you communicate telepathically with others, those creatures perceive a slight pulsing radiance emanating from the soulmeld. You can communicate telepathically with any creature within a range of 20 feet per point of invested essentia, as long as that creature has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Spellward Shirt	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Spellward Shirt			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraHeart				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:Incarnum forms into a cerulean tunic that covers your torso, fitting comfortably over any other clothing or armor you wear. Except for its unusual color, it seems like a relatively mundane garment-until you are subjected to any spell effect. When that happens, the color of the shirt comes alive, forming intricate patterns of swirls, bursts, and spirals as the shirt attempts to deflect the magical energy. Meldshapers have long sought ways to use their own unique magic to protect them from the arcane and divine effects that are so common in the world, and the spellward shirt is one of the simplest such means. While worn, the spellward shirt grants you spell resistance 5. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your spellward shirt increases the spell resistance granted by the soulmeld by 4. Chakra Bind (Heart) The soul energy of your spellward shirt is bound into your flesh, its cerulean color tinting your skin all over your body. When you shape this soulmeld, choose four spells of 6th level or less. You gain complete immunity to the effects of these spells, as if you were under the effect of a spell immunity spell.

Sphinx Claws	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Sphinx Claws				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraHands.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:A powerful set of retractable, catlike claws forms over your hands. These magical claws seem almost alive, and they perfectly follow every move of your own hands and fingers. Sphinxes are among the most powerful and majestic of all magical beasts. In the view of some totemists, they embody what it is to be a magical beast. Totemists hold up different varieties of sphinx as the pinnacle of sphinxkind: the gruff and noble androsphinx, the clever and enigmatic gyno sphinx, the avaricious and powerful crio sphinx, or the detestable hieracosphinx. Whichever variety a totemist seeks to emulate, the effects of sphinx claws are the same-they make the totemist a clawing, pouncing terror to behold. While wearing sphinx claws, you gain a +1 competence bonus on Strength checks and Strength-based skill checks, such as Climb and Jump checks and checks made to break down doors or to bull rush an opponent. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your sphinx claws increases the competence bonus by 1. Chakra Bind (Hands) Your hands become one with the claws that surround them, overlarge for your size. The most profound change, however, is in your proficiency in combat-a powerful urge grows within you to leap at your foes, tearing with claws and teeth until your prey lies motionless in your savage grip. When you use the charge action, at the end of your charge you can make a full attack using any natural weapons you possess. You can use natural weapons that you have by virtue of your race or kind, or natural weapons derived from soulmelds you have shaped. If you elect to use this ability, you cannot make any attacks with manufactured weapons at the end of the same charge. Chakra Bind (Totem) Your hands become one with the claws that surround them, overlarge for your size. You find you can use them to tear at your foes, and with that ability comes a powerful desire to put these tools to use. Will you temper that bloodlust with the wisdom of the gynosphinx or the nobility of the androsphinx? Or will you give in to it completely, rampaging like a hieracosphinx? You can use your sphinx claws as natural weapons that deal 1d8 points of damage plus your Strength modifier. For every point of essentia you invest in your sphinx claws, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus on your attack rolls and damage rolls with the claws. While the claws are shaped, you can retain the normal use of your hands at any time, although you cannot hold an item in your hand and attack with the claws at the same time.

Strongheart Vest	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Strongheart Vest			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraHeart.ChakraWaist				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:A heavy web belt of cyan energy wraps around your torso. When you wear it, you feel energized and revitalized. When you are struck by an attack that would damage your ability scores, a wave of incarnum energy passes through you, blunting the effectiveness of the attack. The strongheart vest protects you from attacks that would reduce your ability scores. Any time you would take ability damage, such as Constitution damage or Strength damage, the amount of the damage is reduced by 1 point, to a minimum of 0. For example, if you fail a saving throw against the poison of a monstrous centipede and would normally take 2 points of Dexterity damage from its poison, you take 1 point instead. Ten rounds later, if you fail a second saving throw against the poison and would normally take 1 point of Dexterity damage, you take no Dexterity damage instead. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your strongheart vest further reduces ability damage by an additional point. For example, if you have 3 points of essentia invested in this soulmeld, you will subtract 4 points from any ability damage dealt to you. Chakra Bind (Heart) Tendrils of blue-black webbing snake out from the vest, merging with your flesh. When you are struck by an attack that would drain your life force, you feel the energy of the strongheart vest surge through you, and you suffer no ill effect from the attack. You gain immunity to energy drain attacks and death effects. Chakra Bind (Waist) The energy of the vest extends down into your legs, becoming more solid as it spreads. Your strongheart vest also reduces ability drain, such as that from a lamia or wraith. It reduces ability drain at the same rate that it reduces ability damage-1 point plus 1 additional point for every point of essentia invested-each time you would take ability drain.

Despite the material covering your fingertips, the gloves grant you exacting precision in certain tasks-those that typically relate to thievery. You borrow the talents of burglars throughout history to grant yourself a semblance of their ability. While you have theft gloves shaped, you gain a +2 insight bonus on Disable Device, Open Lock, and Sleight of Hand checks. This soulmeld also lets you make Disable Device, Open Lock, and Sleight of Hand checks untrained. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your theft gloves increases the insight bonus by 2. Chakra Bind (Hands) Instead of physical gloves, your theft gloves manifest as a dusky blue color over the skin of your hands. In addition to great precision, you also find your fingertips tremendously sensitive, and they seem to tingle when you run them over something that carries a trap. You gain the trapfinding ability (see page 50 of the Player's Handbook).

Therapeutic Mantle	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Therapeutic Mantle			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraShoulders				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:A sheath of incarnum energy surrounds your body and is slowly absorbed into your skin. As healing magic is applied to you, the affected area sparkles with tiny blue motes. The spirit energy of incarnum resonates with life energy. This soulmeld amplifies spells and effects that repair the physical form. You shape incarnum into a sheath of energy that sinks into your skin and helps to focus healing magic that targets you. Whenever you are the target of a spell or effect that heals hit point damage, the spell heals additional damage equal to its spell level. For example, if you are targeted by a cure serious wounds spell cast by a 7th-level cleric, you would be healed of 3d8+10 points of damage (7 points for the cleric's caster level and 3 points for the spell's level). Essentia: Every point of essentia invested increases the additional healing by 2 more hit points. Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Focused outward, incarnum from the mantle bonds with the healing magic you conjure. Healing spells you cast are accompanied by blue-white motes of incarnum energy. When bound to your shoulders chakra, therapeutic mantle increases the potency of healing spells that you cast. You gain an insight bonus (equal to the number of points of essentia invested in the soulmeld) to your caster level when casting spells of the healing subschool.

Threefold Mask Of The Chimera	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Threefold Mask Of The Chimera	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraCrown.ChakraSoul.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You form incarnum into a three-sided mask that hovers in front of your face. As you turn your head, the mask does not turn with you, so you can look out three different sets of eyes-and somehow each face of the mask seems to color your view of the world through it. The mask depicts the three heads of a chimera-a savage dragon, a fierce lion, and a demonic goat. Totemists look to chimeras as a representation of multiplicity united. In a certain sense, they are the patrons of meldshaping itself-uniting disparate elements of beast souls and humanoid bodies to create powerful effects. At the simplest level, the threefold mask of the chimera grants you the ability to focus your attention in multiple directions simultaneously. You can't be flanked while this soulmeld is shaped. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in your threefold mask grants you a +1 competence bonus on Search and Spot checks. Chakra Bind (Crown) Your threefold mask attaches to your forehead and now moves with your head as you turn. By focusing your concentration, you can tap into the mask's multiple perspectives to act more quickly, though at a cost. At the end of your turn, you can take one extra move action at no cost. If you choose to take this extra move action, you take a -5 penalty on attack rolls and to Armor Class until the end of your next turn. Furthermore, on your next turn, you can take only a single standard action or a move action (but not both, and not a full-round action). Every point of essentia you invest in your threefold mask reduces by 1 the penalty applied on attack rolls and to Armor Class during the round following your extra move action. Thus, if you invest 1 point of essentia in your threefold mask and take an extra move action, your attack rolls and AC for the next round take only a -4 penalty (instead of -5). If you invest 5 or more points of essentia, you take no penalty on attack rolls and to AC made in the round following your extra move action (but are still restricted to taking only a single standard action or move action during that turn). Chakra Bind (Soul) You experience a profound quickness of mind, almost as if three minds were thinking your thoughts and directing your actions, though this multiplicity of views can be confusing as well. This chakra bind functions as the crown chakra bind, except that instead of an extra move action, you can take an extra standard action at the end of your turn. However, on your next turn, you can take no actions. The same penalties as described above also apply in the following round, and they can be reduced by essentia investment as listed above. Chakra Bind (Totem) Your threefold mask is no longer just a mask-your head branches into the three monstrous heads of a chimera. Three pairs of eyes look out on the world at once, three heads direct your actions, and three sets of savage jaws slaver for prey. You can use the heads of your threefold mask to make natural attacks. The dragon head bites for 1d8 points of damage, the lion head bites for 1d6 points of damage, and the goat head gores for 1d6 points of damage. As a standard action, you can attack with any one of these heads, applying your full Strength modifier as a bonus on your damage roll. As a full attack action, you can attack with all three heads, applying your full Strength modifier on all three damage rolls. Alternatively, as part of a full attack, you can make a secondary attack with one head at a -5 penalty, applying only one-half your Strength modifier as a bonus on your damage roll.

Thunderstep Boots	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Thunderstep Boots			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraFeet				PRECLASS:1,Soulborn=1					DESC:You shape incarnum into a pair of heavy boots that fit over your feet and any other boots you might wear. Cobalt steel forms rings around your calves and reinforces the toes of the boots. The legendary soulborn Odravan the Red was known for charging into battle wearing thunderstep boots at the head of a well-trained mercenary unit. Foes who survived Odravan's charge were usually stunned and quickly fell to his allies' swords. When you charge, your thunderstep boots channel sonic energy into your attack. If you hit with a melee attack at the end of a charge, the target takes an additional 1d4 points of sonic damage. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your thunderstep boots increases the damage dealt by 1d4 points. Chakra Bind (Feet) Your thunderstep boots bind themselves to your feet. Any creature taking damage from your thunderstep boots is also stunned for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect.

Totem Avatar	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Totem Avatar				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraArms.ChakraFeet.ChakraHeart.ChakraShoulders.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You shape incarnum into an imposing avatar of bestial power. This corporeal shape fits over your clothing and armor, but it makes you seem like a hulking gray render in outline and features. Your actual body is only barely visible within the gray, hairless form. The render's broad shoulders and sinewy arms encompass yours and extend beyond them to translucent clawed hands scraping the ground. To some totemists, the greatest of the magical beasts are those that walk upright like humanoids but embody raw physical power-gray renders, owlbears, rampagers (described in Monster Manual II), blood apes (described in Monster Manual II), and the dreaded tarrasque. All of these creatures are totems of body strength, with the various abilities that come with physical might. By default, the avatar resembles a gray render in its outline and features, but it changes to resemble different magical beasts if you bind it to a chakra. The totem avatar grants you bonus hit points equal to your meldshaper level. These hit points don't go away first the way temporary hit points do; if this soulmeld is unshaped or suppressed, you lose the hit points granted by it. Essentia: You gain an enhancement bonus to your natural armor bonus equal to the number of points of essentia you invest in your totem avatar. Chakra Bind (Arms) Your totem avatar resembles an owlbear-no less hulking and stooped than the gray render form, but covered in a shaggy coat of feathers and fur. You gain the benefit of the Improved Grapple feat. Chakra Bind (Feet) Your totem avatar resembles a rampager, with four elephantine legs, two muscular arms with hooked claws, a headless body with a gaping maw planted on the forward part of the torso, and a thick tail dragging behind. You gain stability as if you were a four-legged creature, giving you a +4 bonus on checks to resist a bull rush, overrun, or trip attack. You are also treated as if you were one size category larger than normal when making a check to resist a bull rush, grapple, overrun, or trip attack (effectively granting you an additional +4 on such checks). Chakra Bind (Heart) Your totem avatar resembles the legendary tarrasque, though on a much smaller scale. Its hulking form leans forward of your own, its back covered with a thick, spiny carapace. Two mighty horns sprout from its head, and its jaw opens wide to reveal dozens of knifelike teeth. You gain damage reduction 5/magic. The amount of this damage reduction increases by 1 for every point of essentia you invest in the soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Your totem avatar resembles a blood ape, taking on the appearance of a red-furred gorilla. Your natural weapons (whether from soulmelds or other sources) deal damage as if you were one size category larger. Chakra Bind (Totem) When you bind your totem avatar to your totem chakra, you become a little more like the gray render it represents. In particular, your body alters to better fill the musculature of the mighty beast avatar, lending you strength to smite your foes. Your totem avatar grants you a morale bonus on damage rolls made with natural weapons (whether from soulmelds or other natural sources) equal to the number of points of essentia you invest in it.

Truthseeker Goggles	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Truthseeker Goggles			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:Incarnum forms blue-lensed goggles that hover in front of your eyes. The world does not seem blue to you; rather, small details become apparent, whether they are in something you search or in someone's facial expression and posture. Calling upon the soul energy of investigators living and dead, you grant yourself keen powers of detection. While you wear your truthseeker goggles, you gain a +2 insight bonus on Gather Information, Search, and Sense Motive checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your truthseeker goggles increases the insight bonus by 2. Chakra Bind (Brow) Your truthseeker goggles rest firmly before your eyes, granting you sight even in darkness. You gain darkvision out to 60 feet.

Unicorn Horn	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Unicorn Horn				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You shape the pure soul energy of a unicorn into an ivory-colored horn that seems to sprout from your forehead. Its color is an unblemished white, and it seems to glow with a soft blue-white radiance. Its purity flows into you, and it is difficult to conceive of an evil thought with the horn so close to your mind. Unicorns are like lammasus in their devotion to goodness and even surpass them in purity. Good totemists revere them as embodiments of all that is good in nature, and shape unicorn horns when they prepare to do battle with evil-particularly undead. You gain a +2 competence bonus on wild empathy and Move Silently checks. Essentia: Your bonus on wild empathy and Move Silently checks increases by 2 for every point of invested essentia. Chakra Bind (Brow) A streak of white appears in your hair near the unicorn horn, and your eyes change color-becoming deep sea-blue, violet, or fiery gold. You gain the ability to detect evil once per round as a standard action. Chakra Bind (Totem) A tuft of white hair hangs down from your forehead around your unicorn horn, while your forehead itself thickens somewhat to support the horn it bears. All of your hair transforms into a cascading white mane, and if you are male a white beard sprouts from your chin. You can feel purity and energy flowing into your body through your horn. You can gore with the unicorn horn as a natural weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You gain an enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with your horn equal to the number of points of essentia you invest in it. If you hit an undead creature with your horn attack, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage.

Urskan Greaves	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Urskan Greaves				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraFeet.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:Incarnum forms steel plates backed with white fur that fit over your shins, covering any clothing, boots, or armor you might wear. When you walk through ice and snow, your feet find solid purchase. Urskans (magical beasts described in Frostburn: Mastering the Perils of Ice and Snow) are arctic-dwelling creatures much like intelligent polar bears. The other races of the north know and fear them for the heavy plate armor they wear, for their strength and ferocity, and for the fierce power of their charging attacks. It is precisely these qualities that totemists seek to emulate by shaping urskan greaves. You can move across ice and through snow at your normal speed, and you gain a +5 bonus on Balance checks made on ice. Essentia: If you invest essentia in your urskan greaves, they protect you from cold damage. You gain resistance to cold equal to 5 times the number of points of essentia you invest in this soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Feet) White fur covers your lower legs and your urskan greaves merge into your flesh. Strength seems to radiate up from your greaves through your whole frame, lending power to your attacks when you can build up a good running start. You gain the ability to make a powerful charge. When you charge, if your melee attack hits, you deal an additional +1d4 points of damage per point of essentia you invest in your urskan greaves. Chakra Bind (Totem) White fur covers your legs and strength pours through you. No foe can stand in your way when you put all your strength into your charge. When you attempt to overrun an opponent, the target cannot choose to avoid you. You also gain a +2 bonus on your Strength check to knock down your opponent, with an additional +1 for every point of essentia you invest in your urskan greaves.

Vitality Belt	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Vitality Belt				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraWaist				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1					DESC:Incarnum forms a stout metallic belt that girds your waist. The metal gleams silver-blue; links of azure chain bind the plates together. Life and health well up from this belt into your body. Like other soulmelds that draw on incarnum as a source of vitality (including pauldrons of health, lifebond vestments, and therapeutic mantle), the vitality belt translates the soul energy of incarnum directly into physical energy to empower your body. While wearing your vitality belt, you gain a +4 morale bonus on Constitution checks and Constitution-based skill checks (but not on Fortitude saves). Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your vitality belt, you gain bonus hit points equal to your meldshaper level. These are not temporary hit points and are not depleted first as are temporary hit points. You can render yourself staggered, unconscious, or even dead by changing the quantity of essentia invested in this soulmeld. Chakra Bind (Waist) A large star sapphire adorns the center of your vitality belt, gleaming vibrantly in any light. Any time you are subjected to an attack that would drain your vitality, the star at the heart of the sapphire dims momentarily, but your health does not suffer. You are immune to Constitution damage and Constitution drain.

Wind Cloak	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Wind Cloak				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraShulders				PRECLASS:1,Incarnate=1,Soulborn=1			DESC:A gauzy cloak of incarnum settles over you, swirling about you as a gentle breeze blows through your hair. A stirring of air at your feet disturbs nearby dust. The wind cloak coaxes the spirit energy of incarnum to swirl around your body, creating a wind that might deflect small objects or even larger airborne projectiles. The swirling soul energy around you protects you from ranged attacks, absorbing some of the momentum of projectiles and other ranged weapons. You gain damage reduction 2/magic against ranged weapons. (This soulmeld doesn't grant you the ability to damage creatures with similar damage reduction.) The damage reduction granted by wind cloak applies against all ranged weapons regardless of their size. Tiny and smaller flying creatures that attempt to enter your space must succeed on a Fortitude save to do so. Failure means their movement stops adjacent to your space, and any remaining movement left in their action is lost. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested increases the damage reduction by 2. For example, a wind cloak with 2 points of invested essentia would provide damage reduction 6/magic against ranged weapons. Chakra Bind (Shoulders) As arrows fly in, the wind of your soulmeld swirls around, deflecting them away, perhaps even back at your attackers. Bound to the shoulders chakra, wind cloak deflects ranged attacks as if you had the Deflect Arrows feat. You don't need a free hand to use the feat-the wind cloak itself deflects the incoming arrows (or bolts, spears, and so on). This effect functions even if you are caught flat-footed. Every point of essentia you invest in your wind cloak increases by one the number of arrows you can deflect in a round.

Winter Mask	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Winter Mask				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraThroat.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You shape incarnum into a snow-white mask resembling the head of a wolf. A snarling muzzle filled with sharp teeth protrudes from the front of the mask, and eyes like blue ice crystals stare out in defiance. Evil tribes of arctic dwellers particularly revere the winter wolf. It is the embodiment of winter itself-deadly, fierce, cunning, and unrelenting in its assault on life and warmth. Totemists shape winter masks to claim the destructive power of winter as their own. Your touch takes on the bitter cold of winter; you can choose to inflict a chilling fatigue on an opponent you touch in combat. You must make a successful melee touch attack. The target is fatigued unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. Creatures resistant or immune to cold are immune to this effect. Essentia: Your touch attack also deals 1d4 points of nonlethal cold damage for every point of essentia you invest in your winter mask. Chakra Bind (Throat) White fur spreads down from your winter mask to cover your throat. Your mouth is filled with a pleasant cold, like sucking a piece of ice on a hot day. You gain the ability to breathe a cone of cold. Once every 1d4 rounds, you can emit a 15-foot-long cone of cold. Targets in the cone take 2d6 points of cold damage plus 2d6 additional points of damage for every point of invested essentia (Reflex half). Chakra Bind (Totem) Your face blends into that of your winter mask, merging with its lupine features. Your eyes appear in the mask's eye sockets, and they become the pale ice-blue of a winter wolf's eyes. Your jaws become the powerful maw of a winter wolf as well, and frost clings to the white fur around your muzzle as you breathe. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use this bite either as a primary attack (in which case it uses your full base attack bonus and adds your Strength bonus on damage rolls) or as a secondary attack (with a -5 penalty on the attack roll and applying only half your Strength bonus on your damage roll). Every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld adds 1d4 points of cold damage to your bite damage.

Worg Pelt	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Worg Pelt				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraFeet.ChakraHands.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You gather worg spirits around you to form a cloaklike garment. It strongly resembles the pelt of a worg, from the top of the beast's head perched atop your own to forelegs extending down your arms and rear legs hanging behind you. The fur is dark and thick, and glassy red eyes smolder in its face. Worgs are quintessential hunters-stalking predators, quick runners, and fierce combatants. Totemists who shape worg pelt soulmelds hope to emulate some or all of these qualities, and sometimes the worg's malicious evil as well. Your worg pelt grants you a +2 competence bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia that you invest in your worg pelt increases the competence bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks by 2. Chakra Bind (Feet) The hind legs of your worg pelt fuse into your own legs, lengthening your feet and shins while shortening your thighs, enabling you to run on your toes like a predatory animal. Your legs are totally covered in the dark gray fur of a worg. Your base land speed increases by 5 feet, plus an additional 5 feet for every point of essentia you invest in your worg pelt. Chakra Bind (Hands) The forelegs of your worg pelt fuse into your own arms, adding weight and bulk to your hands. Your arms and hands are completely covered in the dark gray fur of a worg. When you hit with a bite attack-whether it is a bite attack you naturally possess, one granted by binding this soulmeld to your totem chakra, or one granted by another soulmeld, spell, or special effect-you can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip you. Chakra Bind (Totem) The head of your worg pelt becomes one with your own head. Your eyes begin to glow red and replace the glassy eyes of the pelt, while your lower jaw extends to join the upper muzzle of the pelt, granting you a fierce bite attack. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use this bite either as a primary attack (in which case it uses your full base attack bonus and adds your Strength bonus on damage rolls) or as a secondary attack (with a -5 penalty on the attack roll and applying only half your Strength bonus on your damage roll). Every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld grants you a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with your bite attack.

Wormtail Belt	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Wormtail Belt				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraWaist.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:Incarnum forms a wide belt of thick purple scales around your waist. Though the belt does not serve as armor (and easily fits around any armor you might wear), it thickens your skin and tints it a faint purple color. The purple worm is one of the most feared magical beasts, particularly by those who live or adventure far beneath the surface of the earth. Many have despaired of ever penetrating its thick hide before dying in its gullet or being poisoned by the stinger at the tip of its tail. This soulmeld, particularly common among totemists in underground communities, is an attempt to emulate the awesome protection and the dangerous power of the purple worm. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your existing natural armor bonus. (If you do not have natural armor, you have an effective natural armor bonus of +0.) Essentia: The enhancement bonus to your natural armor bonus increases by 1 for every point of essentia you invest in your wormtail belt. Chakra Bind (Waist) Rather than forming a belt of purple scales at your waist, the soulmeld shapes plating on the skin of your torso and legs. Dark purple on the back and lighter in front, these scales seem to add to your bulk, and definitely increase your power in melee combat. You gain the Awesome Blow feat (see page 303 of the Monster Manual) and are treated as one size category larger than usual when using it (up to a maximum of Colossal). The save DC to resist your awesome blow is calculated as normal for your soulmelds, rather than being based on the damage you deal. Chakra Bind (Totem) A thick, purple-scaled tail emerges from the back of your wormtail belt. It is long enough that you can reach it around you to attack your foes with the stinger at its end, which drips with poison. You can use your wormtail belt's stinger to make natural attacks. You cannot use the stinger as a natural secondary weapon-using the stinger is the only attack you can make in a given round. You use your full base attack bonus for the attack roll, and the stinger deals 1d6 points of damage. In addition, the stinger delivers a weakening poison that deals initial damage of 1d4 Strength (no secondary damage). A successful Fortitude save negates the poison damage. Every point of essentia you invest in your wormtail belt gives you a +1 enhancement bonus on your attack rolls with the stinger, as well as increasing the poison's save DC as normal.

Yrthak Mask	KEY:Soulmeld ~ Yrthak Mask				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulmeld.ChakraBrow.ChakraTotem				PRECLASS:1,Totemist=1					DESC:You shape incarnum into a bizarre mask, basically crocodilian in form. It lacks eyes entirely, and a weird hornlike protrusion juts from the top and front-resembling the strange yrthak in its overall appearance. Yrthaks inhabit desolate mountainous regions and are not widely revered by totemists. Even so, their association with sound, sonic energy, and hearing makes the yrthak mask a powerful soulmeld. You gain a +4 competence bonus on Listen checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia that you invest in your yrthak mask increases the competence bonus on Listen checks by 2. Chakra Bind (Brow) Your yrthak mask fuses to your forehead, though your mouth still speaks inside the mouth of the mask. Your vision dims somewhat, but you find yourself alive to the world of sounds around you-including some you had never heard before. You find that you can discern a creature's location with great accuracy simply by listening to the sounds it makes. You gain a limited form of blindsense. You can take a move action to pinpoint the location of every creature within 10 feet of you to which you have line of effect. The range of this ability increases by 10 feet for every point of essentia you invest in your yrthak mask. Any creature you cannot see still has total concealment against you, and you still have the normal miss chance when attacking foes with concealment. Visibility still affects your movement. You are still denied your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures you cannot see. Even as your other senses are heightened, your visual acuity diminishes. You take a -4 penalty on Spot checks. To your benefit, you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight. Chakra Bind (Totem) Your yrthak mask becomes your actual face, and your jaws lengthen into the crocodilian maw of a yrthak. The mask is too awkward to allow you to make bite attacks, but you can focus sonic energy through the hornlike protrusion on the front of the mask, using it to stab your foes with rays of pure sound. Once every 2 rounds, you can focus sonic energy into a ray up to 60 feet long. This is a ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of sonic damage to a single target for every point of invested essentia.

###Block: Invocations - Placeholders (Warlock not set up)
Drain Incarnum	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Invocation.Least.2nd				SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:This ephemeral claw reaches into a single creature within 30 feet. Unless the creature succeeds on a Fortitude save, it takes 1 point of essentia damage. A creature without an essentia pool instead takes 1 point of Wisdom damage.
Incarnum Blast	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Invocation.Greater.6th.Eldritch Essence	SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:This eldritch essence invocation allows you to change your eldritch blast into an incarnum blast. Any living creature whose alignment is opposed to at least one component of yours must succeed on a Fortitude save or be dazed for 1 round. (For example, a chaotic good warlock would daze lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, and chaotic evil opponents.) If the creature also has an essentia pool, it also loses 1 point of essentia if it fails the save. Other living creatures take the normal damage for your eldritch blast but are not dazed. Nonliving creatures are entirely unaffected by incarnum blast. You can invest essentia in this invocation once per day as if it were an incarnum feat. Every point of essentia invested in your incarnum blast invocation increases the damage dealt by the blast by 1d6 points, but only against living creatures whose alignment is opposed to at least one component of yours. Once the amount of essentia invested is chosen, it cannot be altered and remains invested for 24 hours.
Incarnum Shroud	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Invocation.Dark.8th				SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:Your incarnum shroud grants you concealment (20%% miss chance) from all attackers, though you do not suffer any miss chance against others because of this invocation. You gain 1 point of essentia when this invocation is in effect. The duration of the invocation is 24 hours. You can invest essentia in this invocation once per day as if it were an incarnum feat. Every point of essentia invested in your incarnum shroud invocation grants you a +1 insight bonus to your Armor Class and on your Fortitude saving throws. Once the amount of essentia invested is chosen, it cannot be altered and remains invested for 24 hours. If your incarnum shroud is dispelled during this time, the essentia investment remains in place, taking effect once again when you activate the invocation.
Steal Incarnum	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Invocation.Lesser.4th				SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:You can use this invocation to steal essentia from a touched opponent for your own use. Unless the creature succeeds on a Fortitude save, it loses 1 point of essentia for every 5 caster levels (to a maximum loss of 4 points at 20th level), and you gain essentia equal to the amount lost. The gained essentia fades after 1 minute, though the essentia loss must be healed or otherwise restored normally. If a creature fails its save against this invocation, it can't be affected by it again for 24 hours. A target without essentia can't be affected by this invocation.
