However, the grafted creature can use the ghostly arm to deliver an incorporeal touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, the equivalent of a ghost's corrupting touch attack.

#Undead Skin		SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:This mottled gray hide grants the grafted creature 25%% resistance to critical hits and sneak attacks, similar to armor of light fortifi cation. This resistance doesn't stack with similar abilities.
