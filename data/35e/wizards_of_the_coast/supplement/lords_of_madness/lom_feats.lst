Craft Aboleth Glyph		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation.Wizard.Monstrous.Aboleth	PRERACE:1,Aboleth%	PRETEXT:Caster Level 5.		DESC: The creature can create a permanent glyph of warding effect that automatically recharges and replenishes its own energy after a short period of inactivity after it is triggered. Crafting an aboleth glyph takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of an aboleth glyph is its caster level × spell level × 1,000 gp. To create the glyph, the creature must spend 1/25 of the base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of the base price. A newly created glyph functions exactly as if the creature had cast glyph of warding on the affected area, except that the glyph automatically reappears 1 minute after it is discharged. Similarly, if the glyph is dispelled, it reforms as good as new 1 minute later. An aboleth glyph can be destroyed only in the same manner that a magic item can be destroyed—Mordenkainen’s disjunction, physical destruction of the glyph, and so on. Alternatively, the aboleth can create a master glyph. Each master glyph is a unique glyph with specifi c effects and base costs; several sample master glyphs are detailed later in this chapter.
Death Frenzy			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Monstrous.Aboleth	PRERACE:1,Aboleth%	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,Diehard	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,Endurance		DESC:If the aboleth is reduced to fewer hit points than its total Hit Dice, it automatically enters a death frenzy. Entering this state is an immediate action; the aboleth can enter a death frenzy even when it’s not its turn. While in a death frenzy, the aboleth cannot cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or use supernatural special attacks. When an aboleth enters a death frenzy, it gains a +4 morale bonus to its Strength and Dexterity, and the threat range for all its natural attacks doubles. When it makes a full attack, it  can make one additional attack each round at its highest base attack bonus. Its land speed increases by 10 feet, and its swim speed increases by 20 feet. Finally, it gains fast healing 2. A death frenzy lasts until the creature is killed or until its hit points rise enough to equal or exceed its total number of Hit Dice. Upon emerging from a death frenzy, the creature immediately takes 1d4 points of Strength damage.

Thickent Mucus			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Monstrous.Aboleth	PRERACE:1,Aboleth%	PRESTAT:1,STR=28	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,Enlarge Mucus Cloud	DESC:Creatures within range of the mucus cloud have their swim speed reduced by half if they start their movement in the cloud. Additionally, all creatures in melee with this aboleth take a –1 penalty on attack rolls, Armor Class, and Refl ex saving throws.Aboleths, skum, and creatures transformed by an aboleth’s slime attack are unaffected by Thicken Mucus and can move through the cloud without penalty.When on land, this ability affects only nonaboleth (or nontransformed creatures) that walk through the mucus puddle. The land speed of these creatures is reduced by half, and their swim speed is not affected. Flying creatures are not affected. Freedom of movement negates these penalties.  
Toxic Mucus				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Monstrous.Aboleth	PRERACE:1,Aboleth%	PRESTAT:1,STR=28	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,Enlarge Mucus Cloud	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,Thicken Mucus	DESC:Any creature that comes in contact with the mucus cloud becomes poisoned. The creature must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + half the aboleth’s Hit Dice + Con modifi er) ortake 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. One minute later, the creature must save again against the same DC or take another 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. Creatures that remain in the mucus cloud for multiple rounds must make additional saving throws each round. Aboleths, skum, and creatures transformed by an aboleth’sslime attack are immune to the effect of Toxic Mucus and can move through the cloud without penalty. When on land, this ability affects only nonaboleth (or nontransformed creatures) that walk through the mucus puddle; fl ying creatures are not affected. An aboleth must replenish its mucus constantly to maintain the poisonous qualities. Samples taken from the aboleth retain their toxic qualities for only 1 minute.  
Agile Tyrant			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Monstrous.Beholder	PRERACE:1,Beholder%	DESC:You can aim an additional eye into a single 90-degree arc.

Disintegration Finesse	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Monstrous.Beholder		PRESTAT:1,DEX=13	PRETEXT:Ability to cast Disintegrate or use it as a spell-like or suprnatural ability.		DESC:When the creature uses disintegrate on a target, it can elect to disintegrate only portions of the target. Against living targets, it still does the normal amount of damage, but any parts of the target it wishes to spare remain unaffected by the spell. The creature could, for example, disintegrate only a target’s skeleton, leaving its skull untouched. It also can voluntarily reduce the amount of damage dealt. Against nonliving targets, the creature can use disintegrate to sculpt and reshape the object in any manner desired, as long as the result is no larger in volume or size than the original object. The quality of the result is determined by a Craft (sculpting) check.  Can be used to target specific areas if you are using those rules.
Disjunction Ray			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Monstrous.Beholder	PRESTAT:1,CHA=19	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Focused Antimagic	PRERACE:1,Beholder%	PRETEXT:Functional Antimagic ability.	DESC:s a standard action, the creature can reduce the cone-shaped area of effect of its central eye’s antimagic cone down to a razor-thin eye ray. If the creature hits a magical effect or magic item with this narrowed eye ray, it disjoins the effect or item as if it had cast Mordenkainen’s disjunction on the effect or item. Beholders avoid using this narrowed ray on magic items since the destruction of a magic item also destroys a potential source of magic that could be used to charge their dweomerlobes.
Focused Antimatic 		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Monstrous.Beholder		PRERACE:1,Beholder%	PRETEXT:Functional Antimagic ability.	DESC:The creature can reduce the cone-shaped area ofeffect of its central eye to target a single creature or object. Thetarget must be within range of its normal cone-shaped effect(150 feet).
Metaray					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Monstrous.Beholder	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,TYPE.Metamagic	PRERACE:1,Beholder%	DESC:Once per round, as a standard action, the creaturecan enhance one of its eye rays with the effect of a metamagic at that it possesses. Enhancing an eye ray in this manner burns the eyestalk out for a number of rounds equal to the amount by which the metamagic would normally increase a spell level. Since fi ring an eye ray that hasn’t been enhanced with metamagic is a free action, the creature still can use its other eye rays in a round in which it enhances one ray with metamagic.  The creature cannot use this ability with ametamagic feat that would increase the level of a spell by morethan three levels.
Skilled Telekinetic		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Monstrous.Beholder		PRETEXT:Ability to use telekinesis as a supernaturalability					DESC:As a standard action, the creature can use its telekinetic power to trigger a command word, spell completion,or spell trigger magic item as long as the item is unattendedand the creature would normally utilize the item when holding it.

The item must otherwise fulfi ll all the requirements for manipulating an object via telekinesis (such as weight).
