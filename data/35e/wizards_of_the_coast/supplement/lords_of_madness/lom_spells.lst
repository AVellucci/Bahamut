Glyph of Warding, Elder	KEY:Glyph of Warding (Elder)	CLASSES:Cleric=9	DESC:As per Glyph of Warding, except a blast glyph does %1d8 damage and a spell glyph can hold 9th level spells|min(CASTERLEVEL,30).  Material Component: You trace the elder glyph with incense, which first must be sprinkled with powdered diamond worth at least 1,000 gp.	COMPS:V,S,M		VARIANTS:Blast|Spell
Permeable Form						COMPS:V					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3	CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 round		DESC:By altering the essential nature of the matter composing your body, you make yourself incorporeal for a brief time. While incorporeal, you can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, you have a 50% chance to ignore damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). You can enter or pass through solid objects as described under the incorporeal subtype on page 310 of the Monster Manual. Tsochar spellcasters sometimes use this spell to quickly exit an inhabited creature without causing damage to the victim. You cannot attack while in this state, but you can perform other actions as your incorporeal nature allows. Casting this spell is an immediate action. You can cast it even when it’s not your turn. You can only take one swift, immediate, or quickened action per turn. 
Whispercast							COMPS:V					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 swift action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 round		DESC:The next spell you cast can be cast as a purely mental action, provided that it is of 5th level or lower and that you can whisper. It requires no somatic or material components, unless the spell normally requires a focus or an expensive material component (any component worth more than 1 gp). If the spell does require a focus or an expensive component, you can still whispercast it as long as you have the focus or expensive component on your person—the magic of whispercast causes the focus to be used or the expensive component to be consumed normally, without you having to handle or manipulate it. If you do not cast a second spell while whispercast is in effect, you gain no benefi t from casting whispercast. Casting this spell is a swift action. It does not require a move action or standard action, but you can take only one swift, immediate, or quickened action per turn. Tsochari spellcasters use this spell to permit spellcasting while they inhabit other creatures. It is also useful for grappled spellcasters.  
Arms of Plenty	SCHOOL:Transmutation	COMPS:V,S,M	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One Creature	DURATION:%1 rounds|CASTERLEVEL	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No		DESC:Two clawed arms grow out of the subject’s body. The arms are roughly humanoid, but are either scaly or furred and end in sharp talons. The spell transforms any clothing or armor worn by the creature to accommodate these additional arms; when the duration ends the creature’s clothing and armor return to normal. The arms grant the subject two primary claw attacks. A hit from one of the claws deals slashing damage equal to 1d6 points (1d4 if Small) plus the creature’s Strength modifi er. The claws cannot be used to wield weapons or manipulate objects. Since the claws are primary attacks, you can attack with them in addition to making your weapon attacks without penalty. The claws count as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If both claw attacks hit the same target, the arms can rend the target for extra damage equal to 2d6 points plus 1-1/2 times the subject’s Strength modifier. Multiple castings of arms of plenty on a creature do not stack; the duration simply resets. Material Component: A xill’s claw.
Befoul	SCHOOL:Transmutation	DESCRIPTOR:Evil	CLASSES:Cleric=8	DOMAINS:Corruption=8	COMPS:V,S,M	CASTTIME:1 Minute	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Water in a %1 by %1 by %2 volume.|CASTERLEVEL*100|CASTERLEVEL*10	DURATION:Permanent; see text 	SAVEINFO:None; See Text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:The caster makes water (or other liquid) foul and mildly poisonous. All creatures with 1 Hit Die or less that are in the water at the time of the casting die immediately. Anyone drinking this water must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Any creature with 2 or more Hit Dice immersed in this water must make a saving throw as if drinking it. If the caster affects only part of a larger body of water, the befouled water mixes with the pure water. If the entire body of water is no more than four times the size of the affected area, all the water in the body of water is befouled 24 hours later, but the damage from drinking or swimming in the water is only 1d2 points of Constitution damage. If the body of water is more than four times the affected area but less than twenty times the affected area, after 24 hours all of the water tastes foul but has no damaging effect. If the entire body is larger than twenty times the affected area, fouled water mixes with the clean water and loses all effect after 24 hours. Material Components: A dead fish and a drop of poison. 
Blast of Force	DOMAINS:Force=3	COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium (%1 ft)|100+(CASTERLEVEL*10)	TARGETAREA:Ray	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Fortitude Partial; See Text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You direct an invisible blast of force at a chosen target. The blast is a ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). In addition, a successful hit forces the target to make a Fortitude save or be knocked down (size and stability modifi ers apply to the saving throw as if the spell were a bull rush).
Bolts of Bedevilment	SCHOOL:Enchantment	DOMAINS:Madness=5	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affeting	COMPS:V,S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium (%1 ft)|100+CASTERLEVEL*10	TARGETAREA:Ray	DURATION:%1 rounds|CASTERLEVEL	SAVEINFO:Will Negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This spell grants you the ability to make one ray attack per round. The ray dazes one living creature, clouding its mind so that it takes no action for 1d3 rounds. The creature is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it), but it can’t move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and so on.
Brain Spider	SCHOOL:Divination	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting	CLASSES:Cleric=8	DOMAINS:Mind=7	COMPS:V,S,M,DF	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:Long (%1 ft)|400+40*CASTERLEVEL	TARGETAREA:Up to eight living creatures within range	DURATION:%1 minutes|CASTERLEVEL	SAVEINFO:Will Negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This spell allows you to eavesdrop as a standard action on the thoughts of up to eight other creatures at once, hearing as desired: • The ceaseless chaos representing images of surface thoughts. • Individual trains of thought in whatever order you desire. • Information from all minds about one particular topic, thing, or being, one nugget of information per caster level. • A study of the thoughts and memories of one creature of the group in detail. Once per round, if you do not perform a detailed study of one creature’s mind, you can attempt (as a standard action) to implant a suggestion in the mind of any one of the affected creatures. The creature can make another Will saving throw to resist the suggestion, using the save DC of the brain spider. (Creatures with special resistance to enchantment spells can use this resistance to keep from being affected by the suggestion.) Success on this saving throw does not negate the other effects of the brain spider for that creature. You can affect all intelligent beings of your choice within range (up to the limit of eight), beginning with known or named beings. Language is not a barrier, and you need not personally know the beings—you can choose, for instance, “the nearest eight guards who must be in that chamber there.” The spell cannot reach those who make a successful Will save. Material Component: A spider of any size or kind. It can be dead, but it must still have all eight legs.
