Armored Vermin								SOURCEPAGE:p.60	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric,druid=4	COMPS:V, S, DF; Drow	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:Up to three vermin, no two of which are more than 30 ft. apart	DURATION:1 round/level (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:You cause the exoskeletons of up to three vermin to harden to the strength of steel. The spell increases the vermin’s natural armor bonus by 2. This bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 7th, to a maximum of +6 at caster level 19th. The enhancement bonus provided by armored vermin stacks with the target’s natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A vermin with no natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.
Bebilith Blessing								SOURCEPAGE:p.61	SCHOOL:Transmutation	DESCRIPTOR:Chaos|Evil	CLASSES:Cleric=5	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:1 round/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless); see text	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:You infuse a target with the essence of a bebilith (MM 42), causing it to gain the mandibles and claws of this demon. The target gains two primary claw attacks (in addition to its normal claw attacks, if any) and a secondary bite attack (replacing its normal bite attack). The claws deal 1d6 points of damage, and the bite deals 1d8 points (assuming Medium size). If it is wielding a weapon, the target can attack with either a single claw or a bite as a secondary attack. The target can sunder objects with its claw attacks as if it had the Improved Sunder feat. The target’s bite attack carries a poison (injury; Fort save equal to the spell’s save DC; 1d6 Con/2d6 Con). The target of this spell is also treated as an outsider of the evil subtype in addition to its normal type and subtypes.
Combat Readiness								SOURCEPAGE:p.61	SCHOOL:Divination	CLASSES:Assassin,bard,sorcerer,wizard=1	COMPS:V	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:1 minute/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:The touched creature gains a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks for every three caster levels you have (minimum +1, maximum +6). In addition, if the target is fl anked, its opponents gain no bonus on attack rolls (but still gain any other benefi ts derived from fl anking, such as extra sneak attack damage)
Dominate Vermin								SOURCEPAGE:p.61	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric,druid=3	COMPS:V, S, DF; Drow	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One vermin	DURATION:1 minute/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You invest your psyche into a single vermin creature, granting it your Intelligence. While it is so affected, you can direct it with simple commands such as “Attack,” “Run,” and “Fetch.” Since you are in absolute control of the creature, it even follows suicidal commands. You can continue to direct the vermin as long as it remains within range. You need not see it to control it. Changing your instructions or giving a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action. If the vermin is slain, your mind is forced out of the creature violently. The experience deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage to you.
Dridershape									SOURCEPAGE:p.61	SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph	CLASSES:Sorcerer,wizard=5	COMPS:V, S; Drow	CASTTIME:1 swift action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 round/level (D)	DESC:You take on the form and abilities of a drider (MM 89). You gain 20 temporary hit points, which disappear at the end of the spell’s duration. You don’t gain the drider’s spellcasting ability, but you retain your own. (Spellcasting is subject to the drider’s ability scores; for instance, you can’t cast wizard spells above 5th level, since your new Intelligence is only 15). Any held objects remain held in the new form (other gear melds into the new form as normal). See page 59 for details of the polymorph subschool.
Engulfing Terror								SOURCEPAGE:p.61	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	CLASSES:Druid,sorcerer,wizard=3	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 full round	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One gelatinous cube	DURATION:1 round/level	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:Engulfi ng terror creates a gelatinous cube (MM 201) in a space you designate. The space must be large enough to accommodate the creature. If not, the spell automatically fails. Upon appearing, the cube acts on your turn, attacking the nearest living creature each round. You have no control over it and cannot direct it. The gelatinous cube remains until it is destroyed or has no remaining targets to attack, at which point it moves away in a random direction.
Magical Backlash								SOURCEPAGE:p.62	SCHOOL:Abjuration	CLASSES:Bard,hexblade,sorcerer,wizard=2	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Fortitude half	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Magical backlash causes any spells affecting the target to resonate painfully. For each spell currently in effect on the target (not counting magical backlash itself), magical backlash deals 2 points of damage per level of that spell. For example, a creature targeted by magical backlash that is under the effects of bull’s strength, blur, and mage armor spells would take 4 points of damage for bull’s strength, 4 for blur, and 2 more for mage armor for a total of 10 points of damage.
Shadow Double								SOURCEPAGE:p.62	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Shadow	CLASSES:Assassin=1|hexblade,sorcerer,wizard=2	COMPS:V	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One shadowy duplicate	DURATION:1 round/level	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You create a shadowy duplicate of yourself at a place you indicate within range. The shadow double attacks any adjacent target (regardless of the weapon it appears to wield), as you desire, starting in the round when you cast the spell. It attacks on your turn once each round, striking with an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus + the modifi er for your spell save DCs. Each hit deals 1 point of Strength damage to the target. The fi rst time a target is hit, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect; this negates the damage and renders it immune to further attacks by the shadow double. The shadow double occupies a space identical to yours. It is not incorporeal, and thus can’t share a space with another creature or object. It can provide a fl anking bonus against any creature that hasn’t yet saved successfully against it. The shadow double can strike incorporeal creatures, but not ethereal creatures. Each round after the fi rst, you can use a standard action to direct the shadow double to attack any other target. To attack this new target, the shadow double can move to any new legal space within 30 feet (it moves by instantaneous teleportation). If it is not commanded to switch targets, it continues to attack the same target. A shadow double can be attacked. It has an Armor Class equal to 10 + your size modifi er + a defl ection bonus equal to the modifi er for your spell save DCs, and has one-fi fth of your full normal hit points. If the shadow double is reduced to 0 hit points, or if you create a second shadow double when the fi rst still exists, the spell ends.
