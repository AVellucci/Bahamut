Hellfire Blast		KEY:Hellfire Warlock ~ Hellfire Blast			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellfire Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:Whenever you use your eldritch blast ability, you can change your eldritch blast into a hell fire blast. A hellfire blast deals your normal eldritch blast damage plus an extra 2d6 points of damage per class level. If your blast hits multiple targets (for example, the eldritch chain or eldritch cone blast shape invocations), each target takes the extra damage. This damage is not fire damage. Hellfire burns hotter than any normal fire, as described in the sidebar on page 119. Each time you use this ability, you take 1 point of Constitution damage. Because the diabolical forces behind the power of hellfire demand part of your essence in exchange for this granted power, if you do not have a Constitution score or are somehow immune to Constitution damage, you cannot use this ability.
Invoking			KEY:Hellfire Warlock ~ Invoking				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellfire Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:At each level, you gain new invocations known, increased damage with eldritch blast, and an increase in invoker level as if you had also gained a level in the warlock class. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained.	BONUS:VAR|WarlockEldritchBlastLVL|HellfireWarlockLVL
Resistance to Fire 10	KEY:Hellfire Warlock ~ Resistance to Fire 10		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellfire Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:At 2nd level, you gain resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with any resistance to fire you have gained from warlock class levels.	BONUS:VAR|FireResistanceBonus|10
Hellfire Infusion		KEY:Hellfire Warlock ~ Hellfire Infusion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellfire Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, you can infuse magic items that you wield with the power of hellfire. Whenever you use a charged magic item (such as a wand or a staff ), you can apply one of the following metamagic effects to your next use of the item: empower, enlarge, widen, or energy substitution. These effects work just like the metamagic feats of the same name (the Energy Substitution feat is described on page 79 of Complete Arcane). Using hellfire infusion is a swift action. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum one). When you infuse an item with hellfire, it glows briefl y with fiery symbols that are disturbing to look upon.
Hellfire Shield		KEY:Hellfire Warlock ~ Hellfire Shield			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellfire Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, you can call up hellfire to surround yourself with a protective barrier. Whenever someone directs a melee attack against you, you can, as an immediate action, aim a blast of hellfire at that creature. This blast deals damage equal to your eldritch blast (including bonus damage from the hellfire blast ability). This blast automatically strikes the target, which can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier). Each time you use this ability, you take 1 point of Constitution damage. Because the diabolical forces behind the power of hellfire demand part of your essence in exchange for this granted power, if you do not have a Constitution score or are somehow immune to Constitution damage, you cannot use this ability.
