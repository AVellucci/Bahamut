Adamantine Wings		CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7				SCHOOL:Transmutation							TYPE:Arcane	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours [D] or until expended							SPELLRES:No			DESC:You grow a pair of adamantine wings. The wings grant you a fly speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor or carry a medium or heavy load), with good maneuverability. If you are not flying, you can use a standard action to make one wing attack or a full attack action to make two such attacks (as if they were natural weapons). Each wing deals 2d6 points of slashing damage (plus your Strength modifier), and threatens a critical hit on a 19 20. The wings are considered both magic and adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction or penetrating hardness. Wing strikes are not additional attacks; they replace any other attack or full attack action. As a swift action, you can choose to launch the adamantine feathers as a burst of razor-sharp blades. This attack takes the form of a 60-foot cone-shaped burst. All creatures within the cone take 10d6 points of damage (Reflex half; spell resistance applies). Since this is a spell effect, damage reduction does not affect the damage dealt by the cone. This action immediately ends the spell's duration.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.95	TEMPDESC:Wings grant fly 60 ft., provide natural attacks.
Allied Footsteps		CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2				SCHOOL:Divination								TYPE:Arcane	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 full round		RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:Creature Touched					DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days [D]				SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes(harmless)	DESC:The subject of the spell knows the direction and approximate (within 10%%) distance he must travel to reach you, enabling him to find you under almost any circumstances. He might not know the best route, however, since the spell does not account for obstacles. The spell works at any distance and continues even if you die. If you travel to a different plane, or if either you or the target enters an antimagic field or similar area, the spell is temporarily suppressed.																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.95	TEMPDESC:Subject knows direction and distance to your location.
Animate Weapon		CLASSES:Assassin,Hexblade=2|Sorcerer,Wizard=3	SCHOOL:Transmutation							TYPE:Arcane	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		ITEM:Potion	TARGETAREA:Weapon touched					DURATION:Concentration + 1 round				SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)	SPELLRES:Yes		DESC:A weapon affected by this spell gains the ability to move and attack on its own and functions in most ways like an animated object of its size (MM 13). Treat a light weapon as an object two size categories smaller than its wielder, a one-handed weapon as one size category smaller than its wielder, and a two-handed weapon as an object of the same size as its wielder. However, the weapon deals its normal damage, not the damage noted for an animated object of its size, and it gains a bonus on attack rolls equal to the ability modifier used to set your spell save DCs. Diminutive or smaller objects are unaffected by the spell. An animated weapon attacks the nearest enemy to the best of its ability. You can use a move action to direct it to a different target, but if at the end of your turn you are more than 30 feet from the weapon, the spell ends. A weapon held or carried by another creature can't be affected by this spell. The weapon doesn't gain the benefit of any of your class features, feats, or other special abilities that would improve its combat ability. If the weapon has an enhancement bonus or other special properties, these apply as normal. For example, an animated +1 flaming longsword gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls and deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit.	SOURCEPAGE:p.95	TEMPDESC:A weapon animates and fights for you.
Arboreal Transformation	CLASSES:WuJen(wood)=9					SCHOOL:Transmutation							TYPE:Arcane	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One living creature				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days and permanent; see text	SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial		SPELLRES:Yes		DESC:You transform the subject of the spell into a Huge oak tree. For a number of days equal to your caster level, that oak tree animates as a treant (though it can't animate trees) and serves as you command. You can either command it to follow you, or you can leave it somewhere with a triggering phrase as described in the liveoak spell (PH 248). When the spell's duration expires, the subject becomes in all respects a normal tree, taking root where it stands if capable. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is instead slowed (as the spell) as his body fights off the transformation from within. When the spell's duration expires, the subject returns to normal.																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.95	TEMPDESC:Transform your foe into a tree, which temporarily animates and serves you.
Dawnburst			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1				SCHOOL:Evocation		SUBSCHOOL:Light	DESCRIPTOR:Light	TYPE:Arcane	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		ITEM:Potion	TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius burst				DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]				SAVEINFO:Reflex partial			SPELLRES:Yes		DESC:All creatures in the area glow with light equivalent to a torch for the duration of the spell, making hiding difficult and even revealing the location of invisible creatures. (Invisible creatures are still considered to have concealment.) In addition, undead and creatures within the area that have light sensitivity or light blindness take 1d6 points of damage, +1 point of damage per caster level (maximum +5). A successful Reflex save halves this damage.																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.101	TEMPDESC:Illuminate all creatures in 10-foot radius; deal damage to light-sensitive creatures.
Jet of Steam		CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard,WuJen=1			SCHOOL:Evocation		SUBSCHOOL:Water				TYPE:Arcane	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30ft				TARGETAREA:30-ft.-line						DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Reflex half			SPELLRES:Yes		DESC:You release a powerful jet of superheated steam that deals 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d4) to each creature within its area. The jet begins at your fingertips. The jet of steam deals no damage to objects in its path, nor can it set fire to combustibles.																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	TEMPDESC:30-foot line of steam deals 1d4 fire damage/level (max. 5d4).
Karmic Aura			CLASSES:Hexblade,Sorcerer,Wizard=1			SCHOOL:Abjuration								TYPE:Arcane	COMPS:V	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:20ft		ITEM:Potion	TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds					SAVEINFO:Will partial			SPELLRES:Yes		DESC:While this spell is in effect, any creature within range that deals damage to you with an attack, spell, or other effect becomes fatigued for 3 rounds. Asuccessful Will save indicates that the attacker is unaffected and immune to the spell's effect until the start of your next turn, but must save again if he damages you after that point. An attacker already fatigued suffers no additional effect from this spell. Karmic aura, karmic backlash, and karmic retribution interact in an unusual fashion. If you have more than one of these spells active at once, the subject must save against each spell in descending order of spell level. If he fails any of these saves, he is automatically fails any save against any lower-level spell of the set that you have active. (Spell resistance still applies to each effect separately.)																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.108	TEMPDESC:Any creature damaging you becomes fatigued for 3 rounds.
