This extra damage consists of pure divine energy and is not subject to being reduced by resistance or immunity. At 5th level, this extra damage increases to 2 points per spell level.
#Arcane Smite	KEY:Holy Scourge ~ Arcane Smite	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.Holy ScourgeClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, you can smite evil once per day. This ability functions like the paladin class feature (PH 44), except that you can apply the effect only to an arcane spell that requires a melee or ranged attack roll (such as shocking grasp or scorching ray). In addition to the bonus on the spell's attack rolls and damage rolls, this adds the good descriptor to the spell. At 4th level, you can use this class feature twice per day.

#Spellcasting			KEY:Ultimate Magus ~ Spellcasting	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Ultimate MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At each level except 1st, 4th, and 7th, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in both a prepared arcane casting class and a spontaneous arcane casting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of those classes would have gained. At 1st, 4th, and 7th level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in your arcane spellcasting class with the lowest caster level. For example, a 4th-level wizard/1stlevel sorcerer who gained one level of ultimate magus would gain increased spellcasting ability as if he had gained a level of sorcerer (since that class's caster level is lower than his wizard caster level). If all your arcane spellcasting classes have equal caster levels, you can apply this benefit to any of your existing arcane spellcasting classes. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of those classes would have gained.
#Arcane Spell Power		KEY:Ultimate Magus ~ Arcane Spell Power	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.Ultimate MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, your caster level for all arcane spells increases by 1. It increases again at 4th level, 7th level, and 10th level (to a maximum of +4).
#Expanded Spell Knowledge	KEY:Ultimate Magus ~ Expanded Spell Knowledge	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.Ultimate MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, you can select one 0- or 1st-level arcane spell from your spellbook and add it to the list of arcane spells known for a spontaneous casting class, even if you can't yet spontaneously cast spells of that level. (In this case, you would know the spell but wouldn't be able to cast it until you had spell slots of the appropriate level.) You can add another spell from your spellbook to your list of spells known every two levels thereafter. At 4th level, this can be a 0-, 1st-, or 2nd-level spell. At 6th level, this can be any spell of 3rd level or lower. At 8th level, this spell can be of 4th level or lower, and at 10th level it can be of 5th level or lower.
#Augmented Casting			KEY:Ultimate Magus ~ Augmented Casting	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.Ultimate MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, you can choose to sacrifice a spell or spell slot from one of your classes to apply the effect of a metamagic feat that you know to a spell cast using another arcane class. (For instance, you could sacrifice a sorcerer slot to apply a metamagic effect to a wizard spell.) This sacrificed spell or slot is lost (just as if you had cast the spell) in addition to the spell you are actually casting. The level of the spell to be augmented can't exceed 1/2 your class level. For example, when you first gain this ability, you can only apply a metamagic effect to 1st-level spells. A 10th-level ultimate magus can affect spells of 5th level or lower. The level of the spell slot sacrificed must equal or exceed the spell level adjustment of the metamagic feat. To empower a spell, for example, you would have to spend a 2nd-level or higher spell. You can't use this ability to augment a spell already affected by a metamagic feat. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 your class level.
#Bonus Feat				KEY:Ultimate Magus ~ Bonus Feat	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Ultimate MagusClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, and again at 9th level, you can select a bonus metamagic feat for which you meet the prerequisites.
