For example, a 7th-level fighter/1st-level wizard/5th-level abjurant champion has a base attack bonus of +12 (and thus a caster level of 12th). You can apply this benefit to only one arcane class to which you have added spellcasting levels by your advancement as an abjurant champion.

Eldritch Spellweave		KEY:Eldritch Disciple ~ Eldritch Spellweave		SOURCEPAGE:p.54	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.Eldritch DiscipleClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 5th level, you can apply an eldritch essence invocation you know (other than greatreach blast or spellblast; see the eldritch theurge class features on page 57) to any divine spell that affects a target or that requires a melee or ranged touch attack. The spell's level must be at least as high as the level of the eldritch essence (for example, you can apply hellrime blast only to a spell of 4th level or higher). If the essence requires a saving throw, use the normal save DC for that essence. If an eldritch essence invocation changes the damage of the spell, it can be applied only to a spell that deals damage (you can't add brimstone blast to dimensional anchor, for example). Using this ability increases the spell's casting time to 1 full-round action. A spell that has a normal casting time of 1 full round or longer takes an extra full-round action to cast. If the spell has more than one target or allows more than one attack, you must choose one target to be affected by the invocation; all other targets take only the normal effect of the spell. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier (minimum 1).

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an eldritch theurge, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Invocations			KEY:Eldritch Theurge ~ Invocations			SOURCEPAGE:p.57	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Eldritch TheurgeClassFeature.SpecialQuality			DESC:At each level, you gain new invocations known and an increase in caster level as if you had also gained a level in an invocation-using class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level.

Spellblast			KEY:Eldritch Theurge ~ Spellblast			SOURCEPAGE:p.57	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.ClassFeature.Eldritch TheurgeClassFeature.SpecialQuality		DESC:This invocation (Lesser; 4th; Eldritch Essence), learned at 3rd level, allows you to place an arcane spell that affects an area upon your eldritch blast. If the eldritch blast hits its target, the spell's area is centered on any corner of the target's space, even if the spell could normally be centered only on the caster. If the eldritch blast misses its target, the spell is lost with no effect. It takes a full-round action to cast the spell and fire the eldritch blast. Only an area spell with a casting time no greater than 1 standard action can be placed upon your eldritch blast. Only the first target of your eldritch blast is affected by the spell (for example, an eldritch chain spellblast centers the spell on the initial target, not on any of the secondary targets). If your eldritch blast doesn't specify a target, you can't apply this invocation to the blast. Treat spellblast as a spell whose level is equal to the area spell placed upon the eldritch blast (minimum 4th level).

The spell's level must be at least as high as the level of the eldritch essence (for example, you can apply hellrime blast only to a spell of 4th level or higher). If the essence requires a saving throw, use the normal save DC for that essence. If an eldritch essence invocation changes the damage of the spell, it can be applied only to a spell that deals damage (you can't add brimstone blast to charm monster). Using this ability increases the spell's casting time to 1 fullround action. A spell that has a normal casting time of 1 full round or longer takes an extra full-round action to cast. If the spell has more than one target or allows more than one attack, you choose one target to be affected by the invocation; all other targets take only the normal effect of the spell. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier (minimum 1).
Greatreach Blast		KEY:Eldritch Theurge ~ Greatreach Blast		SOURCEPAGE:p.58	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.ClassFeature.Eldritch TheurgeClassFeature.SpecialQuality		DESC:This invocation (Greater; 5th; Eldritch Essence) allows you to place an arcane spell with a range of touch upon your eldritch blast. If the eldritch blast hits its target, the spell takes effect on that target as if you had touched it. If the eldritch blast misses its target, the spell is lost with no effect. It takes a full-round action to cast the spell and fire the eldritch blast. Only a touch spell with a casting time no greater than 1 standard action can be placed upon your eldritch blast. Only the first target of your eldritch blast is affected by the spell (for example, an eldritch greatreach chain delivers the touch spell on the initial target, not on any of the secondary targets). If your eldritch blast doesn't specify a target, you can't apply this invocation to the blast. Treat greatreach blast as a spell whose level is equal to the touch spell placed upon the eldritch blast (minimum 5th level).

SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Nightmare Phantasm	KEY:Nightmare Spinner ~ Nightmare Phantasm	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, when you cast a figment or glamer spell, you can choose to weave a thread of nightmare phantasm into it as a free action. The spell gains the phantasm descriptor. Each time any enemy attempts a Will save to disbelieve the affected illusion spell, a tiny portion of the spell transforms into a phantasm effect that targets that enemy. The enemy becomes shaken for 1 round (no save). This ability has no other effect on the original spell's duration or effectiveness. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier. No creature can be affected by your nightmare phantasm ability more than once in a 24-hour period. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.	SOURCEPAGE:p.74

SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Deadly Nightmare		KEY:Nightmare Spinner ~ Deadly Nightmare		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, you can create a mind-affecting fear effect that can make a living creature literally drop dead.

Even if the save succeeds, the subject is panicked for 1 round. Any creature whose Hit Dice exceed twice your character level is unaffected by this power. This is a mind-affecting fear death effect. You can use this power three times per day.																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.75
