###Block: Abjurant Champion
Spellcasting		KEY:Abjurant Champion ~ Spellcasting		SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.Abjurant ChampionClassFeature.SpecialQuality			DESC:At each level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an abjurant champion, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Abjurant Armor		KEY:Abjurant Champion ~ Abjurant Armor		SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.Abjurant ChampionClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Any time you cast an abjuration spell that grants you an armor bonus or shield bonus to AC, you can increase the value of the bonus by your abjurant champion class level. Abjurant champions rely on mage armor, shield, and similar spells instead of actual armor.
Extended Abjuration	KEY:Abjurant Champion ~ Extended Abjuration	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.Abjurant ChampionClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:You depend on your abjuration spells to protect you in combat. Double the duration of abjuration spells you cast, as if you had applied the Extend Spell feat to them (but without any change in level or casting time).
Swift Abjuration		KEY:Abjurant Champion ~ Swift Abjuration		SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.Abjurant ChampionClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you can cast abjuration spells as a swift action, as if you had applied the Quicken Spell feat to them (but without any change in level). The maximum level of spell you can quicken in this way is equal to 1/2 your class level (rounded up).
Arcane Boost		KEY:Abjurant Champion ~ Arcane Boost		SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeature.Abjurant ChampionClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, you gain the ability to burn arcane energy to empower your martial abilities. As a swift action, you can spend one of your uncast spells or spell slots to grant yourself one of the following insight bonuses for 1 round. . Bonus on attack rolls equal to the spell's level. . Bonus on weapon damage rolls equal to twice the spell's level. . Bonus to AC equal to the spell's level. . Bonus on saving throws equal to the spell's level. . Resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic equal to 5 x the spell's level.
Martial Arcanist		KEY:Abjurant Champion ~ Martial Arcanist		SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeature.Abjurant ChampionClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, you master the art of combining your militant and mystical training. From this point on, your caster level in a chosen arcane spellcasting class is equal to your base attack bonus (unless it would otherwise be higher). For example, a 7th-level fighter/1st-level wizard/5th-level abjurant champion has a base attack bonus of +12 (and thus a caster level of 12th). You can apply this benefit to only one arcane class to which you have added spellcasting levels by your advancement as an abjurant champion.

###Block: Nightmare Spinner Abilities
# Ability Name		Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																																																																							Source Page
Inspire Fear		KEY:Inspire Fear ~ Nightmare Spinner		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, you can create a mind-affecting fear effect that makes a living creature within 30 feet ill at ease. The target becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to your nightmare spinner class level; a successful Will save (DC 10 + your class level + your Cha modifier) halves this duration. You can use this power a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier. Multiple uses of this ability on the same creature don't stack.																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Nightmare Phantasm	KEY:Nightmare Phantasm ~ Nightmare Spinner	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, when you cast a figment or glamer spell, you can choose to weave a thread of nightmare phantasm into it as a free action. The spell gains the phantasm descriptor. Each time any enemy attempts a Will save to disbelieve the affected illusion spell, a tiny portion of the spell transforms into a phantasm effect that targets that enemy. The enemy becomes shaken for 1 round (no save). This ability has no other effect on the original spell's duration or effectiveness. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier. No creature can be affected by your nightmare phantasm ability more than once in a 24-hour period. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Spirit Chill		KEY:Spirit Chill ~ Nightmare Spinner		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, creatures affected by a fear effect you cause (whether by a spell, class feature, or other effect) take nonlethal damage as well, depending on the potency of the fear created. Any creature that is shaken takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. A creature that becomes frightened takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage, while a creature that becomes panicked takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage.																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Deadly Nightmare		KEY:Deadly Nightmare ~ Nightmare Spinner		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, you can create a mind-affecting fear effect that can make a living creature literally drop dead. You can target one living creature within 30 feet of you, which must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + your class level + your Cha modifier) or literally die of fright. Even if the save succeeds, the subject is panicked for 1 round. Any creature whose Hit Dice exceed twice your character level is unaffected by this power. This is a mind-affecting fear death effect. You can use this power three times per day.																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.75
