You set the conditions your Affliction causes at each degree when you acquire it and they may not be changed. Higher degree conditions replace lower degree conditions and do not stack with them. See the possible conditions for each degree under the Affliction Resistance Check table. The target resists with Fortitude or Will defense (chosen when you take the effect):

	ASPECT:Cost|1 point per rank
	DESC:You can burrow through the ground, leaving a tunnel behind if you choose. You move through soil and sand at a speed rank equal to your Burrowing rank, minus 5. So Burrowing 8, for example, lets you move through the ground at speed rank 3 (around 16 MPH). Burrowing through hard clay and packed earth reduces speed one additional rank. Burrowing through solid rock reduces it by two additional ranks. The tunnel you leave behind is either permanent or collapses behind you immediately (your choice when you begin burrowing each new tunnel). Note that Burrowing differs from the Permeate effect of Movement, which allows you to pass through an obstacle like the ground at your normal speed without disturbing it at all (see Movement for details).
	ASPECT:Resistance Check|
	DESC:Penetrating: Normally, the hardness of the ground affects only the speed at which you burrow. At the GM’s discretion, some super-hard materials may be considered Impervious to Burrowing, in which case this extra allows you to dig through them. 1 point per rank. Ranged: This extra either allows you to create tunnels at a greater distance (without having to be at the end-point of the tunnel as it forms) or, in conjunction with Affects Others, allows you to grant the Burrowing effect to someone else at a distance. Doing both requires two applications of the extra. +1 or 2 cost per rank.
	DESC:Limited: Burrowing may be limited to certain circumstances or materials, such as only loose sand and soil (leaving the character unable to burrow through dense clay or solid rock), or only snow and ice (being unable to burrow through earth and soil at all). –1 cost per rank.

	DESC:You can communicate over a distance using a medium other than your normal voice. Choose a sense type as your Communication medium (see the list of examples). You may also use a special sense type (like neutrinos, gravitons, magical sendings, and so forth) noticeable only to an appropriate form of the Detect effect (see Senses in this chapter), at the GM’s discretion. • Visual: laser or fiber optic link • Auditory: ultrasonic or infrasonic beam, “ventriloquism” • Olfactory: pheromones or chemical markers • Tactile: vibratory carrier wave • Radio: AM, FM, and short-wave radio bands, microwaves • Mental: telepathic transmission, psychic link, mystical sending Your rank determines you maximum Communication range. Communication is instantaneous with any subject within your range. The recipient of your communication must be within range and have a means of receiving your transmission (super-sense, or a receiver of some sort; conscious awareness is all that’s needed to “receive” Mental Communication). You can receive Communication of the same medium as your own. Receivers can choose to ignore your Communication, if they wish. Communication is language- dependent; you and the subject must share a common language (see Comprehend to communicate across language barriers). Your Communication is point-to-point (sent to a single receiver within your range). Activating your Communication effect is a free action. Communicating, however, takes the normal amount of time. You can apply the Rapid modifier to speed things up, provided your recipient is capable of receiving communication at that speed. Others with an acute sense able to detect your Communication medium can “tap into” your transmissions with a Perception check (DC 10 + your Communication rank). The eavesdropper must be within normal sensory range of you or the receiver. With two degrees of success on the check, the eavesdropped can also understand your transmissions. Effects like Concealment and Dazzle that target your Communication medium can “jam” or block your transmissions.
	DESC:Area: You can broadcast omni-directionally to every receiver within your maximum Communication range at once. Note this extra is only strictly necessary to communicate with everyone over a wide area all at once; since using and maintaining Communication are free actions, the GM may allow a communicator to establish and maintain contact with multiple discrete receivers—such as the members of the same team—all in the same round. +1 cost per rank.
	DESC:Dimensional: Communication with this modifier can bridge dimensional barriers, reaching into other dimensions and planes of existence. The Communication effect still has its proximate range, and the GM may rule certain subjects “out of range” of the effect, depending on their relative positions in the other dimension. Flat +1 point.
	DESC:Rapid: Your communication occurs 10 times faster than normal speech. Each additional rank increases communication speed by a factor of 10. This is useful for high-speed computer links, “deep sharing” psychic rapports, and so forth. Flat +1 point.
	DESC:Selective: If you have the Area extra, you can choose which receiver(s) within range get your Communication, excluding everyone else. This allows you to go from a single receiver (point-to-point) to all potential receivers in range (omni-directional) or anywhere in between. +1 cost per rank.
	DESC:Subtle: Your Communication cannot be “overheard” (it is encrypted, scrambled, or otherwise protected). With 2 ranks, your Communication cannot even be detected (that is, no one can even tell you are transmitting, much less what you’re saying). Flat +1 or 2 points.
	DESC:Limited: Communication may be limited to only members of a particular group, such as a species, family, members of an organization, and so forth. This is in addition to limitations imposed by medium (that is, requiring subjects to have a means of picking up on the Communication). –1 cost per rank.
	DESC:Sense-Dependent: Communication itself is already sense-dependent (in that the subject(s) must be able to sense your communication medium to pick up your transmissions) and so cannot have this flaw. However, other perception range effects can be Communication- Dependent, meaning you must be in communication with your subject for them to work (using your Communication medium as a “carrier” for the other effect). If your Communication is blocked in any way, the other effect doesn’t work. -1 cost per rank.

	DESC:	You can comprehend different sorts of communication. Each rank in this effect allows you to choose one of the following options:

Animals			KEY:Comprehend ~ Animals				CATEGORY:Power	DESC:You can either speak to or comprehend animals. You can ask questions and receive answers, although animals are not any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while especially stupid ones make inane comments. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you. For 2 ranks you can both speak to and understand the “speech” of animals.
Languages			KEY:Comprehend ~ Languages				CATEGORY:Power	DESC:You can either speak or understand the language of any intelligent creature. You can speak only one language at a time, although you can comprehend multiple languages at once. This effect does not enable you to speak with creatures that don’t possess a language. For 2 ranks you can both speak and understand all languages. For 3 ranks anyone able to hear you can understand what you’re saying, regardless of language. Being able to also read any language you comprehend requires 1 additional rank.
Languages (Read)		KEY:Comprehend ~ Languages (Read)			CATEGORY:Power	DESC:You can either speak or understand the language of any intelligent creature. You can speak only one language at a time, although you can comprehend multiple languages at once. This effect does not enable you to speak with creatures that don’t possess a language. For 2 ranks you can both speak and understand all languages. For 3 ranks anyone able to hear you can understand what you’re saying, regardless of language. Being able to also read any language you comprehend requires 1 additional rank.
Machines			KEY:Comprehend ~ Machines				CATEGORY:Power	DESC:You can communicate with electronic devices, making inquiries and understanding their replies. This requires two Comprehend ranks. Most are limited by their programming and peripherals in terms of what they “know,” and may not be able to answer some inquiries with anything other than an “unknown” or “not found.” At the GM’s discretion, you can use the Technology skill as an interaction skill when communicating with machines.
Objects			KEY:Comprehend ~ Objects				CATEGORY:Power	DESC:You can communicate with inanimate objects, granting them the ability to speak to you or simply “reading” impressions from them. This requires two Comprehend ranks. Objects only “know” about events directly affecting them or occurring in their immediate area. Gamemasters can apply the guidelines for Postcognition (see page 126) to this effect.
Plants			KEY:Comprehend ~ Plants				CATEGORY:Power	DESC:You can communicate with plants, both normal plants and plant creatures. This requires two Comprehend ranks. A plant’s sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won’t be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity.
Spirits			KEY:Comprehend ~ Spirits				CATEGORY:Power	DESC:You can communicate with incorporeal and normally invisible and inaudible spirit beings, such as ghosts or certain extradimensional entities, depending on the context of the setting. Rank 1 essentially allows you to function as a “medium” of sorts, able to perceive spirits and relay what you see and hear. Rank 2 allows you to be clearly understood by denizens of the spirit world, as well. At the GM’s discretion, this effect may extend to undead creatures, demons, or other supernatural entities, depending on the setting.
Spirits (Understood)	KEY:Comprehend ~ Spirits (Understood)		CATEGORY:Power	DESC:You can communicate with incorporeal and normally invisible and inaudible spirit beings, such as ghosts or certain extradimensional entities, depending on the context of the setting. Rank 1 essentially allows you to function as a “medium” of sorts, able to perceive spirits and relay what you see and hear. Rank 2 allows you to be clearly understood by denizens of the spirit world, as well.

	DESC:You gain total concealment from a particular sense while this effect is active, although you are still detectable to other senses (even other senses of the same sense type; so you could have full concealment against normal sight, but not infravision or any other sense in the sight sense type). Each additional rank gives you concealment from another sense; two ranks give you concealment for an entire sense type. See Concealment on page 101 for the full effects. Concealment from visual senses costs double (2 ranks for one visual sense, 4 ranks for all visual senses). You cannot have concealment from tactile senses, since that requires being incorporeal (see the Insubstantial effect). So with Concealment 5, you can have total concealment from all visual senses (4 ranks) and normal hearing (1 rank), for example. With Concealment 10 you have total concealment from all sense types other than tactile.

Affects Others	KEY:Concealment ~ Affects Others		CATEGORY:Power	DESC:This modifier allows you to grant Concealment to others while you are touching them, or at range, if you also apply the Range modifier. +1 cost per rank.
Area			KEY:Concealment ~ Area				CATEGORY:Power	DESC:Concealment with Affects Others (previously) or Attack (immediately following) may have this extra, affecting everything in the area. To only affect some targets in the area, apply the Selective modifier as well. +1 cost per rank.
Attack		KEY:Concealment ~ Attack			CATEGORY:Power	DESC: Use this extra for a Concealment effect you can impose on others (whether they want to be concealed or not). An invisibility ray, for example, is a Visual Concealment Attack, while a field of darkness is a Burst Area Visual Concealment Attack. +0 cost per rank.
Precise		KEY:Concealment ~ Precise			CATEGORY:Power	DESC: You can vary your Concealment at will as a free action: going from total to partial to no concealment, concealing some parts and not others, or anywhere inbetween. If your Concealment affects multiple senses, you can also choose to affect some of those senses and not others. Concealment is normally all-or-nothing: either you are concealed to the full amount of your effect, or you’re not. Flat +1 point.
#	FLAW	
Blending		KEY:Concealment ~ Blending			CATEGORY:Power	DESC: You “blend” into the background. Your Concealment only functions as long as you move no faster than your (ground speed rank –1), since your blending can’t adapt faster than that. -1 cost per rank.
Limited		KEY:Concealment ~ Limited			CATEGORY:Power	DESC: Your Concealment only works under certain conditions, such as in fog, shadows, or in urban locales. One example is Limited to Machines, where your Concealment only fools senses with a technological descriptor. -1 cost per rank.
Partial		KEY:Concealment ~ Partial			CATEGORY:Power	DESC: Your effect provides partial rather than total concealment (see Concealment, page 101, for details). -1 cost per rank.
Passive		KEY:Concealment ~ Passive			CATEGORY:Power	DESC: Your Concealment only lasts until you do something requiring an attack or effect check on your part, at which point it stops working until you reactivate it, which you may do on the following round. -1 cost per rank.
Resistible		KEY:Concealment ~ Resistible			CATEGORY:Power	DESC: Your Concealment offers a resistance check (chose a defense when the flaw is applied) for anyone aware of your presence and actively looking for you. Concealment Resistible by Will may represent some sort of mental illusion effect. -1 cost per rank.

	DESC:You can form solid objects essentially out of nowhere. They may be made of solidified energy, “hardened” water or air, transmuted bulk matter, ice, stone, or some other medium, depending on the effect’s descriptors. You can form any simple geometric shape or common object (such as a cube, sphere, dome, hammer, lens, disk, etc.). The GM has final say on whether or not a particular object is too complex for this effect. Generally, your objects can’t have any moving parts more complex than a hinge. They can be solid or hollow, opaque or transparent, as you choose when you use the effect, limited by your descriptors and the Gamemaster’s judgment. You can create an object with a maximum volume rank equal to your effect rank and Toughness equal to your effect rank. Created objects can be damaged or broken like ordinary objects. They also vanish if you stop maintaining them. You can repair any damage to a created object at will by using your effect again (essentially “re-creating” the object). Your created objects are stationary once you have created them, although other effects can move them. Assume a created object has a mass rank equal to its volume rank.

Innate		KEY:Create ~ Innate		CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Continuous or Permanent Create with this modifier makes objects that cannot be nullified, they’re essentially “real” objects for all intents and purposes (although the user can “unmake” them at will unless the effect is also permanent). Flat +1 point.
Movable		KEY:Create ~ Movable		CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You can move your created objects around with a Move Object effect at your Create rank (see Move Object in this chapter for details). +1 cost per rank.
Precise		KEY:Create ~ Precise		CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You can create more precise and detailed objects. The exact parameters of Precise Create are up to the GM, but generally, you can create objects with moving parts, and considerable detail. Flat +1 point. 
Selective		KEY:Create ~ Selective		CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You can make your created objects selectively “transparent” to attacks, blocking some while allowing others (yours and your allies’, for example) to pass through them. You can also selectively make your objects solid to some creatures and incorporeal to others, such as allowing one person to walk through a created wall, while blocking another. It takes a free action to change the selective nature of an object; permanent created objects cannot have their selectivity changed once they are created. +1 cost per rank.
Stationary		KEY:Create ~ Stationary		CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Your created objects can hang immobile in the air. They resist being moved with a Strength rank equal to the modifier rank. Unless you have the Tether extra or the Movable extra, you cannot move a stationary created object once it’s placed any more than anyone else can. +0 cost per rank.
Subtle		KEY:Create ~ Subtle		CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:This modifier either makes created objects not noticeable as constructs for 1 rank (they look just like real objects) or not noticeable at all for 2 ranks (such as objects composed of invisible force). Flat +1or 2 points.
Tether		KEY:Create ~ Tether		CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You have a connection to your created objects, allowing you to exert your own Strength to move them (provided you are strong enough to do so). Flat 1 point.

Unlike Continuous Create, you cannot choose to dismiss such objects; they are truly permanent. You cannot repair permanent created objects or otherwise alter them once they’re created. +0 cost per rank (for a Sustained effect).
Proportional	KEY:Create ~ Proportional	CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Your created objects have a total volume rank plus Toughness rank equal to your Create rank, rather than both volume and Toughness up to your rank. So you can create an object with volume rank 0 and Toughness equal to your Create rank, vice versa, or anywhere in between, so long as the sum of the two ranks does not exceed your Create rank. –1 cost per rank.

Reflect		KEY:Damage ~ Reflect		CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You can reflect attacks back at the attacker as a free action.

See the Defend action in the Action & Adventure chapter for details. You use your Deflect rank in place of an active defense. You still add 10 to a Deflect die roll of 10 or less, for a minimum roll of 11. Deflect modifiers are limited by power level. Like a ranged attack, if you Deflect at medium range, you have a –2 circumstance modifier on your check. At long range, you have a –5 circumstance modifier. Range is measured from you to the target of the attack you are deflecting. Like the defend action, Deflect does not work against area effects or perception ranged attacks, nor versus attacks targeting defenses other than Dodge or Parry.

Add your effect rank to your normal size rank to determine how far you can elongate; for a normal-sized human (size rank –2) this is 15 feet at rank 1, 30 feet at rank 2, and so forth. Rank 20 Elongation can stretch 1,000 miles! “Snapping back” to your normal shape is a free action. You can use Elongation to make “close” attacks at a greater distance by elongating your limbs. Once elongated, you can make melee attacks within your new reach as a standard action. If you can’t accurately sense your target (you’re elongating around a corner, for example), apply the rules for concealment (see Concealment in the Action & Adventure chapter). In addition, Elongation allows you to wrap up and entangle an opponent so it grants a +1 bonus to grab checks per rank (limited by PL).

	DESC:You can temporarily improve one of your existing traits, chosen when you take this effect. While this effect is active, you increase the affected trait by its rank. So, for example, Enhanced Strength 5 increases your Strength by +5 while it is active. Your enhanced trait is still subject to power level limits, so your unenhanced rank must be below the limit by at least the amount of the enhancement to accommodate it. The cost of Enhanced Trait is the same per rank as acquiring a rank in the affected trait. The key differences are that Enhanced Trait is a power effect, rather than a natural trait, and as an effect it can be combined with extra effort and other effects. See Extra Effort in The Basics chapter and Enhanced Abilities in the Abilities chapter for more.

Limited		KEY:Enhanced Trait ~ Limited	CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Enhanced Traits are often Limited in some fashion, such as Nighttime (or Daytime) Only, While Angry (or in another emotional state), Underwater (or in some other environment), and so forth. A limit that rarely comes into play—like losing your Enhanced Trait during a new moon—can be handled as a power loss complication. See Complications in The Basics chapter for details. –1 cost per rank.
Permanent		KEY:Enhanced Trait ~ Permanent	CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:At no change in cost, your Enhanced Trait may be a permanent improvement, rather than a sustained effect. The primary difference is that your permanent enhancement cannot be turned on and off and cannot be improved by extra effort, including using it to perform power stunts (see Extra Effort). There is no action to use a Permanent Enhanced Trait, as it is always active. +0 cost per rank.
Reduced Trait	KEY:Enhanced Trait ~ Reduced Trait	CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:One or more of your traits is lowered while others are enhanced. This flaw is worth as many points as the reduction in the affected trait(s). So, for example, if you lose Intellect while you gain in Strength, treat the value of the lost Intellect ranks as the value of the flaw. As with all flaws, the effect must still cost at least 1 power point. Flat –points equal to the lowered trait.

Your Environment affects a 30 foot radius around you at rank 1. Each additional rank moves the radius up one distance rank, for a reach of approximately 2,000 miles at rank 20, sufficient to alter the environment of an entire continent! Each of the following is a separate Environment effect. If you have one you can acquire others as Alternate Effects, but you can then only use and maintain one at a time. To use or maintain multiple Environment effects simultaneously, add their costs together for the effect’s total cost per rank or apply the Selective modifier, allowing you to mix-and-match effects.

Selective		KEY:Environment ~ Selective	CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:With this extra you can vary the environment within your affected area, affecting some while not affecting others, or even mixing and matching different environments (making part of the area cold and another hot, for example). +1 cost per rank.

	DESC:You have extra manipulative limbs, such as arms, tentacles, or even prehensile hair or a tail. Each rank in this effect grants you an extra limb. Extra Limbs do not allow you to take additional actions in a round, although they do provide the benefits of the Improved Grab advantage—grabbing with some of your limbs and leaving others free. All additional limbs except your dominant limb are considered your “off-hand.” If you have the Benefit (Ambidexterity) advantage, you have no off-hand penalties with any of your limbs. If you apply all of your limbs to a grab attempt (rather than taking the option to leave some of them free), you gain a +1 circumstance bonus per rank in Extra Limbs to a maximum of +5, much like a team check (see page 16).

#	EXTRA
Continuous		KEY:Extra Limbs ~ Continuous			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Continuous Extra Limbs are a power effect you can turn on and off at will, but that remain until you choose to deactivate them, even if you are stunned or incapacitated . +1 cost per rank.
Projection		KEY:Extra Limbs ~ Projection			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Your Extra Limbs are merely a projection of your power rather than an extension of your body. Therefore, any harm directed specifically against your Extra Limb(s) has no effect. So, for example, one of your additional limbs could reach into a container of acid or a blast furnace to pull out an object without any harm to you. The GM may require Extra Limbs with this extra to modify their duration to continuous or sustained, but this is not essential. It’s likely Extra Limbs with this extra are not eligible for the Innate modifier. +1 cost per rank.
Sustained		KEY:Extra Limbs ~ Sustained			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Sustained Extra Limbs can be turned on or off (growing or forming the additional limbs and then making them disappear just as easily), but the limbs disappear or stop working if you are unable to continue the effect. +0 cost per rank.
#	FLAW	
Distracting		KEY:Extra Limbs ~ Distracting			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Coordinating the actions of your multiple limbs is difficult, so you are vulnerable while applying any extra limbs to an action. This flaw should generally not apply to any creature with Innate Extra Limbs, especially if they are part of its natural physiology. -1 cost per rank.

	DESC:You have one or more minor features, effects granting you an occasionally useful ability, one per rank. This effect is essentially a version of the Benefit advantage (see page 82) but a power rather than a virtue of skill, talent, or social background. For example, diplomatic immunity or wealth are Benefits; fur, the ability to mimic sounds, or a hidden compartment in your hollow leg are Features. It’s up to the GM what capabilities qualify as Features; generally, if something has no real game effect, it’s just a descriptor. If it has an actual game system benefit, it may be a Feature. There’s no need to define every possible Feature a character may have down to the last detail. Some Features may be sustained duration rather than permanent with no change in cost. This suits active Features a character has to use and maintain rather than having them as passive traits requiring no effort whatsoever.
	ASPECT:Resistance Check|

# Sample Features
Insulating Fur		KEY:Feature ~ Insulating Fur			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You have a layer of fur that protects you from intense heat and cold, giving you immunity to those environments.
Internal Compartment	KEY:Feature ~ Internal Compartment		CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You can carry a portion of your carrying capacity inside your body! You have a pouch or compartment of some sort, able to hold objects with a size rank no greater than 3 less than your own (size -5 for a normal size rank -2 human).
Iron Stomach		KEY:Feature ~ Iron Stomach			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You can eat anything that’s not toxic without ill effects, no matter how unpleasant it may be: spoiled or particularly gross or spicy food, for example.
Mimicry			KEY:Feature ~ Mimicry				CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You can imitate almost any sound you’ve heard, giving you a +10 bonus to Deception checks to convince others your mimicked sounds are real.
Quick Change		KEY:Feature ~ Quick Change			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You can change clothes—such as into or out of your costume—as a free action. With 2 ranks, you can change into any outfit at will.
Special Effect		KEY:Feature ~ Special Effect			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You have some special effect, like a gust of wind at the right dramatic moment, or ideal spotlighting, or personal theme music. The GM may give you a +2 bonus for favorable circumstances when your special effect is likely to impress people or otherwise aid you.
Temporal Inertia		KEY:Feature ~ Temporal Inertia			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You are somehow uniquely “anchored” in the space-time continuum, making you immune to changes in history. You recall the “true” version of historical events, even if no one else does.

Aquatic		KEY:Flight ~ Aquatic			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You can move underwater as easily as in the air. You have a water speed equal to your Flight rank, minus 2, subject to the usual rules for swimming (see the Athletics skill description for details). You can make Athletics checks to swim as routine checks. This power does not allow you to breathe underwater (for that see Immunity, page 113). This is the Swimming power as an Alternate Effect. Flat +1 point.
Continuous		KEY:Flight ~ Continuous			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Continuous Flight operates even when the user is incapacitated or otherwise unable to sustain it. The user remains hanging in the air, maintaining relative position to the ground, if necessary. Alternately, the user might float safely down to the ground when unable to maintain Flight as a kind of “safety net,” your choice when you apply the modifier. +1 cost per rank.
Subtle		KEY:Flight ~ Subtle			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:The default Flight effect is noticeable, whether from the rush of air, the roar of jets, or a glowing contrail or aurora, for example. This modifier reduces, and then eliminates, these traces. If your Flight is completely Subtle, you do not need to make Stealth checks to move silently while flying (you do so automatically), although you may still need to do so to avoid being seen or otherwise detected. Flat +1 or 2 points.

Concentration	KEY:Flight ~ Concentration		CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Flight requiring concentration means you can fly, but can’t do much else at the same time. –1 cost per rank.
Distracting		KEY:Flight ~ Distracting			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You are not very maneuverable and therefore vulnerable while flying (see the Vulnerable condition in The Basics chapter). –1 cost per rank.
Gliding		KEY:Flight ~ Gliding			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You fly by gliding on wind currents. Your maximum gliding distance is limited to the vertical distance rank of your starting height, plus your flight speed rank. You may be able to gain altitude occasionally by catching thermal updrafts and winds at the GM’s discretion. Otherwise you must land at the end of your maximum distance. –1 cost per rank.
Levitation		KEY:Flight ~ Levitation			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You can only move vertically, straight up and down, and not side to side, although you can allow yourself to be carried along in the direction of the wind horizontally. –1 cost per rank.
Platform		KEY:Flight ~ Platform			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Your Flight is reliant on some sort of platform on which you stand or sit. If you fail a resistance check while flying, or you are grabbed by someone standing on the ground, you’re knocked or pulled off your platform and cannot fly. You can regain the use of your flying platform by reactivating your Flight effect on your next turn. –1 cost per rank.
Wings			KEY:Flight ~ Wings	CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You have wings that allow you to fly, but they run the risk of being fouled or restrained, which prevents you from flying. If you are immobilized, restrained, or bound, you cannot fly. You can regain the use of your wings by reactivating your Flight effect once you are no longer affected by the aforementioned conditions. –1 cost per rank.

	DESC:You can temporarily increase your size, gaining Strength and Stamina at the cost of becoming a bigger, heavier, less agile target, unable to maneuver through small spaces. Growth modifiers are restricted by power level limits. Each rank of Growth adds 1 rank to your Strength and Stamina (constructs add 1 rank to Strength and Toughness if they lack Stamina) and adds 1 rank to your mass. Every two ranks adds a +1 bonus to Intimidation. Every 8 ranks adds 1 to your Speed. Every rank of Growth subtracts 1 from your Stealth checks. Every 2 ranks (rounded up) subtracts 1 from your Dodge and Parry defenses. Every 4 ranks of Growth increases your size rank by 1 (ordinary humans start out at size rank –2, between 3 and 6 feet tall). So at Growth 8, you have +8 Strength and Stamina, +4 to Intimidation, +1 Speed, but -8 to Stealth, –4 Dodge and Parry, and you are size rank 0 (around 30 feet tall). Increases to your Strength and Stamina also improve related traits like your Strength Damage, Fortitude, and Toughness.

	DESC:You can heal Damage conditions by touching a subject and taking a standard action to make a DC 10 Healing check. Each degree of success healing one Damage condition, starting with the subject’s worst condition, and working down, as if the subject were recovering rapidly. If the subject is dying, the highest degree of success stabilizes the subject, removing the dying condition. If the Healing check fails, you must wait one minute or use extra effort in order to try again. You can also grant a subject a bonus equal to your Healing rank on resistance checks against effects with disease or poison descriptors. The bonus applies to the subject’s next resistance check against the effect. You can use Healing on yourself, provided you are still capable of taking the standard action needed. Healing does not work on subjects unable to recover on their own, such as creatures with no Stamina rank or inanimate objects.

#	EXTRA
Action		KEY:Healing ~ Action			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:This extra reduces the action required for you to use Healing. You cannot use Healing more than once per turn regardless. To heal multiple subjects at once, apply the Area modifier. +1 cost per rank.
Affects Objects	KEY:Healing ~ Affects Objects		CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Your Healing can also “heal” damage to non-living subjects. You make a Healing check against the subject’s worst damage condition, as normal. +1 cost per rank.
Area			KEY:Healing ~ Area				CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Healing with this extra grants the same benefit to all subjects in the affected area. Area Empathic Healing (see this power’s Flaws) is an unwise combination, as the healer takes on all of the damage conditions of the affected subjects at once! +1 cost per rank.
Energizing		KEY:Healing ~ Energizing			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You can heal the fatigued and exhausted conditions as well as damage conditions: DC 10, one degree of success for fatigued, two degrees of success for exhausted. However, you take on the removed conditions and cannot use Healing to eliminate your own fatigue (although you can still use hero points to recover from them). If the Healing check fails, you must wait the normal recovery time or use extra effort to try again. +1 cost per rank.
Perception		KEY:Healing ~ Perception			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Applied to Ranged Healing (following), Perception Ranged Healing does not require an attack check to “touch” the subject. +1 cost per rank.
Persistent		KEY:Healing ~ Persistent			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Your Healing can remove even Incurable effects (see the Incurable modifier). Flat +1 point.
Ranged		KEY:Healing ~ Ranged			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Ranged Healing requires an attack check to “touch” the subject with the Healing effect. The GM may waive the check for a willing subject holding completely still, but the subject is defenseless that round, making it an unwise decision in the midst of combat. +1 cost per rank.
Restorative		KEY:Healing ~ Restorative			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Your Healing effect can restore power points removed by Weaken effects with the appropriate descriptors, such as injury, disease, or poison. You restore points equal to your rank to the affected trait(s). +1 cost per rank.
Resurrection	KEY:Healing ~ Resurrection		CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You can restore life to the dead! If the subject has been dead for fewer minutes than your Healing rank, makes a DC 20 Healing check. If successful, the patient’s condition becomes incapacitated, as if just stabilized. If the check fails, you can only try again using extra effort. +1 cost per rank.
Selective		KEY:Healing ~ Selective			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Area Healing may have this extra, allowing you to choose who in the area does and does not gain the benefits. +1 cost per rank.
Stabilize		KEY:Healing ~ Stabilize			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:You don’t need to make a Healing check to stabilize a dying character, your Healing effect does so automatically, although it still requires the normal standard action. Flat +1 point.
#	FLAW	
Empathic		KEY:Healing ~ Empathic			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:When you successfully cure someone else of a condition, you acquire the condition yourself and must recover from it normally. You can use Healing and Regeneration to cure your own conditions. You can have the Resurrection modifier for Healing, but if you successfully use it, you die! This may not be as bad as it seems if you have Immortality, allowing you to return to life (see the Immortality effect for details). –1 cost per rank.
Limited		KEY:Healing ~ Limited			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Examples of ways in which Healing may be Limited include: One Type of Damage (such as energy or bludgeoning damage), Objects (in conjunction with Affects Objects), Others (you can’t use Healing on yourself), or Self (you can only use Healing on yourself). –1 cost per rank.
Temporary		KEY:Healing ~ Temporary			CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:The benefits of your Healing are temporary, lasting for one hour. The subject then regains any damage conditions you healed. These conditions stack with others the subject acquired since the initial healing, which may result in more severe damage or even death. –1 cost per rank.

#	FLAW	
Feedback			KEY:Illusion ~ Feedback				CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Although Illusion does not have a physical “manifestation” per se, it can apply this flaw, in which case a successful damaging attack on one of your illusions causes you to suffer damage, using the guidelines given in the description of the Feedback flaw. –1 cost per rank.
Limited to One Subject	KEY:Illusion ~ Limited to One Subject		CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Only a single subject at a time can perceive your Illusion. –1 cost per rank.
Ranged			KEY:Illusion ~ Ranged				CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:It is left to the GM’s discretion whether or not Illusion’s range can be reduced at all, since being able to perceive the affected area is important in creating and directing the illusion. In order to solely alter your own appearance, see the Morph effect, possibly with the Resistible modifier. –1 cost per rank.
Resistible			KEY:Illusion ~ Resistible				CATEGORY:Power	TYPE:Power	DESC:Illusions Resistible by Will are typically hallucinatory effects projected into the target’s mind. This flaw is commonly combined with Selective, so only the targets you choose perceive your illusions. Illusions Resistible by Fortitude may represent a hallucinatory drug or similar biochemical effect. As usual, targets immune to effects targeting the resistance are unaffected by the illusion as well. So Illusions Resistible by Fortitude or Will have no effect on non-living targets, for example. This resistance check is in addition to the usual Insight check; the first determines if the target can resist the effect creating the illusion, the Insight check determine if the target notices something wrong about the illusion, revealing it as false. –1 cost per rank.

So Immortality 11, for example, restores you to life in just 30 minutes (19 – 11 = time rank 8). At rank 20, you recover from death at the start of each action round! When you recover, all your damage conditions are removed, but you also lose all accumulated hero points, starting over with none.

You can switch between normal and Insubstantial form at will as a free action once per round. The default is that substantial is your “normal” form, but the GM may permit you to make Insubstantial your “normal” form, in which case remaining solid is a sustained duration for you!
