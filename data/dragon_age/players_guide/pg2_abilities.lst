Arcane Warrior	KEY:Class Specialization ~ Arcane Warrior		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Arcane Warrior	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.MageClassSpecialization	PRECLASS:1,Mage=1		PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Magic and Dexterity 3 or higher.							DESC:Among the elves of ancient Thedas there was a tradition that fused the arts of magic and combat. Known as arcane warriors, these mages channeled mana to boost their combat prowess. These abilities are thought by most to be forgotten, another casualty of the wars that destroyed the elven homelands. Though hidden, that knowledge does survive. Due to the rarity of this specialization, the GM should consider requiring it to be unlocked (see Unlocking Specializations). Arcane warriors have not been widely seen in Thedas in hundreds of years. Their return should provide great story and adventure material for your campaign.
Assassin		KEY:Class Specialization ~ Assassin			ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Assassin		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.RogueClassSpecialization	PRECLASS:1,Rogue=1	PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Cunning and Dexterity									DESC:Assassins are masters of the art of death. They train to kill using weapons, poisons, and their wits. The most famous assassins are the Antivan Crows. They will kill anyone for the right price, and because of that they hold the real political power in their homeland. There are always those willing to kill for money, so assassins can be found all over Thedas.
Bard			KEY:Class Specialization ~ Bard			ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Bard		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.RogueClassSpecialization	PRECLASS:1,Rogue=1	PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Communication and Dexterity 3 or higher, and Music (novice).			DESC:Bards may seem like simple minstrels and troubadours, but they are much more. A peculiar feature of Orlesian politics, bards act as spies, saboteurs, and sometimes killers (though they usually prefer to leave that to assassins). Intrigue is a way of life in Orlais, so bards are common there but less so in other nations. Worldly people of all nations look twice at any traveling minstrel, which makes life for honest members of that trade more difficult. It is said that King Maric of Ferelden fell in love with an Orlesian bard with tragic results.
Berserker		KEY:Class Specialization ~ Berserker		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Berserker		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.WarriorClassSpecialization	PRECLASS:1,Warrior=1	PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Strength and Willpower 3 or higher.							DESC:Berserkers rose first among the dwarves of the Warrior Caste. They learned to tap into their rage on the battlefield and use it to perform feats of incredible valor. The Avvars learned from the dwarves and from there the berserker tradition spread to all the human nations. The Ash Warriors are the most famous of the human berserkers. They are mercenaries of a sort, but they do not fight for money. Rather, they lend their considerable might to those whose cause they find the most just. They have fought for many kings of Ferelden but they maintain a stubborn independence.
Blood Mage		KEY:Class Specialization ~ Blood Mage		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Blood Mage	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.MageClassSpecialization	PRECLASS:1,Mage=1		PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Constitution and Magic 3 or higher.							DESC:The Tevinter Imperium conquered Thedas with Blood magic. Its magisters, it is said, learned the craft from demons. Every mage feels its allure. There is much power to be gained using blood instead of mana. The Chantry, however, forbids the practice and on this they are unequivocal. The vile practices of the magisters led to the Blights, and to the Maker turning away from his creations. Blood mages are maleficarum (singular maleficar, from the ancient Tevene, “one who is depraved”) and the Templars hunt them down. Interestingly, some Grey Wardens have been known to dabble with Blood magic. Many Wardens believe that any weapon that can be used against the darkspawn should be, and that includes Blood magic.
Champion		KEY:Class Specialization ~ Champion			ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Champion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.WarriorClassSpecialization	PRECLASS:1,Warrior=1	PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Communication and Strength 3 or higher.						DESC:There are many tough warriors in Thedas, but those that can truly inspire their allies and intimidate their enemies are few. Champions do not just fight; they are a palpable presence on the battlefield. Comrades in arms look to them for strength and courage in the chaos of battle. Foes hesitate and lose heart when facing them. Champions are not unique to any one army or organization. They can be found in all parts of Thedas, and smart commanders recruit as many as possible into their forces when battle approaches.
Duelist		KEY:Class Specialization ~ Duelist			ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Duelist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.RogueClassSpecialization	PRECLASS:1,Rogue=1	PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Dexterity and Perception 3 or higher, and Dual Weapon Style (novice).	DESC:Heavily armed and armored warriors may dominate the battlefield but duelists rule the streets and alleys of cities like Denerim and Val Royeaux. In such conditions the quick blades and wits of duelists count for more than raw strength. They eschew cumbersome shields and fight with a weapon in each hand instead. They have even developed a weapon set customized for their style of fighting. The classic duelist fights with a rapier and either a main gauche or a spiked buckler in their off-hand, though some pride themselves on fighting with more unusual weapon combinations.
Spirit Healer	KEY:Class Specialization ~ Spirit Healer		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Spirit Healer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.MageClassSpecialization	PRECLASS:1,Mage=1		PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Communication and Magic 3 or higher.							DESC:While demons are the most notorious denizens of the Fade, other spirits reside there as well. These spirits are more benevolent and do not have the driving desires that make demons so evil. Spirit healers are those rare mages who learn to communicate and summon such spirits. There is danger in this path, as there always is when the Fade is involved. Sometimes demons pretend to be kindly spirits and the spirit healer pays a dreadful price. When the summoning is successful, however, a spirit healer is capable of healing feats beyond the bounds of normal magic. This is why spirit healers believe the risk is worth it.
Templar		KEY:Class Specialization ~ Templar			ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Templar		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.WarriorClassSpecialization	PRECLASS:1,Warrior=1	PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Magic and Strength 3 or higher.							DESC:The Templars are the militant arm of the Chantry. Their primary functions are to watch over the Circle of Magi and hunt down apostates and maleficarum. For more information about Templars, see Chapter Five: Magic. As noted there, Templars are given small amounts of lyrium to awaken and maintain their special powers. Hard and fast rules for this are not provided, as tracking such things is tedious. The Templars’ use of lyrium makes excellent story fodder, however.

DESC:You have learned a potent mix of magic and melee skills.	DESC:&nl;Novice: You learn a new weapon group of your choice, and you can use Magic to satisfy the minimum Strength requirement of weapons. You can also enter Combat Magic mode by taking an activate action. While in this mode, you add Magic instead of Strength to your damage with melee weapons. However, any spell you cast in Combat Magic mode has its mana point cost increased by 2.

DESC:You know how to kill quickly and efficiently.	DESC:&nl;Novice: You can assess a nearby opponent and spot weaknesses that can be exploited in combat. With an activate action you can mark for death a visible target within 10 yards of you. All ranged and melee attacks against a target marked for death receive a +1 damage bonus.

It can be used in a combat encounter like the other songs, but it’s more appropriate for roleplaying encounters. You perform a song for those assembled that affirms the power of camaraderie and harmony.

Once per round while singing the song, you can attempt to captivate one opponent within 16 yards.

When casting a spell in this mode, you can inflict 1d6 penetrating damage on yourself and you gain mana points equal to the damage. The mana points so generated must be used on the spell you are casting this round; any excess are lost.

Success requires an opposed test of your Magic (Blood) vs. the target’s Willpower (Faith or Self-Discipline). If you win things work as per the journeyman degree. If the target is adjacent to you and helpless (unconscious, tied up, etc.), you inflict 2d6 penetrating damage (and perhaps understand why mages of the Tevinter Imperium were not so popular).|PREVARGTEQ:Talent_Blood_Mage,3	ASPECT:NAME|Blood Mage Talent (Novice)|PREVAREQ:Talent_Blood_Mage,1				ASPECT:NAME|Blood Mage Talent (Journeyman)|PREVAREQ:Talent_Blood_Mage,2		ASPECT:NAME|Blood Mage Talent (Master)|PREVAREQ:Talent_Blood_Mage,3
