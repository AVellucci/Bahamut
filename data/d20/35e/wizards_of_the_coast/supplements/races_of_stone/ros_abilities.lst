Powerful Build				KEY:Powerful Build ~ Goliath		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.RaceAbility	BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT.GRAPPLE|4|PRESIZELT:C	BONUS:WIELDCATEGORY|ALL|-1										SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:The physical stature of a goliath let's him function in many ways as if he were one size category larger. Whenever a goliath is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the goliath is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A goliath is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature's special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A goliath can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject's size category.
