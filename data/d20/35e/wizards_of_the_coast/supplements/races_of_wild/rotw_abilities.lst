Gliding						KEY:Gliding ~ Raptoran			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	MOVE:Glide,40																						BENEFIT:A raptoran can use her wings to glide, negating damage from a fall of any height and allowing 20 feet of forward travel for every 5 feet of descent. Raptoran glide at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability), Even if a raptoran's maneuverability improves, she can't hover while gliding. A raptoran can't glide while carrying a medium or heavy load. If a raptoran becomes unconscious or helpless while in midair, her wings naturally unfurl and powerful ligaments stiffen the wings. The raptoran descends in a tight corkscrew and takes only 1d6 points of falling damage, no matter what the actual distance of the fall.
Flight						KEY:Flight ~ Raptoran			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	MOVE:Fly,40																							BENEFIT:You are able to fly at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability), Raptorans can safely fly for a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). They can exert themselves to fly for up to twice as long, but then they're fatigued at the end of the flight. Raptorans are likewise fatigued after spending a total of more than 10 minutes per day flying. Because raptorans can glide before, after, and between rounds of actual flight, they can remain aloft for extended periods (even if they can only use flight for 1 round at a time without becoming fatigued)|PRELEVEL:MAX=9	BENEFIT:You are able to fly at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability), and flying requires no more exertion than walking or running.|PREPCLEVEL:MIN=10	BENEFIT:A raptoran can't fly while carrying a medium or heavy load or while fatigued or exhausted. A raptoran can make a dive attack. A dive attack works like a charge, but the raptoran must move a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. A raptoran can make a dive attack only when wielding a piercing weapon; if the attack hits, it deals double damage. A raptoran can use the run action while flying, provided she flies in a straight line.
