Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Ninjas are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, kama, kukri, nunchaku, sai, shortbow, short sword, shuriken, and siangham. Ninjas are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.
AC Bonus (Ex)	KEY:AC Bonus ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A ninja is highly trained at dodging blows, and she has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks. When unarmored and unencumbered, a ninja adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her Armor Class. This ability does not stack with the monk's AC bonus ability (a ninja with levels of monk does not add the bonus twice). In addition, a ninja gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five ninja levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level). These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when a ninja is flat-footed. The character loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.
Ki Power (Su)	KEY:Ki Power ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A ninja can channel her ki to manifest special powers of stealth and mobility. She can use her ki powers a number of times per day equal to one-half her class level (minimum 1) plus her Wisdom bonus (if any). Ki powers can be used only if a ninja is wearing no armor and is unencumbered. As long as a ninja's ki pool isn't empty (that is, as long as she has at least one daily use remaining), she gains a +2 bonus on her Will saves. A ninja's ki powers are ghost step, ki dodge, ghost strike, greater ki dodge, and ghost walk. Each power is described under a separate entry below.
Sudden Strike (Ex)	KEY:Sudden Strike ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:If a ninja can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Whenever a ninja's target is denied a Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the ninja deals an extra 1d6 points of damage with her attack. This extra damage increases by 1d6 points for every two ninja levels thereafter. A ninja can't use sudden strike when flanking an opponent unless that opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sudden strikes. A ninja can't make a sudden strike while striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are out of reach. A ninja can't use sudden strike to deliver nonlethal damage. Weapons capable of dealing only nonlethal damage don't deal extra damage when used as part of a sudden strike. The extra damage from the sudden strike ability stacks with the extra damage from sneak attack whenever both would apply to the same target.
Trapfinding (Ex)	KEY:Trapfinding ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A ninja can use the Search skill to locate traps with a DC higher than 20, and she can use Disable Device to bypass a trap or disarm magic traps. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player's Handbook.
Ghost Step (Su)	KEY:Ghost Step ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a ninja can spend one daily use of her ki power to become invisible for 1 round. Using this ability is a swift action (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137) that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 10th level, a ninja can become ethereal when using ghost step instead of becoming invisible.
Poison Use (Ex)	KEY:Poison Use ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, a ninja never risks accidentally poisoning herself when applying poison to a weapon.
Great Leap (Su)	KEY:Great Leap ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level and higher, a ninja always makes Jump checks as if she were running and had the Run feat, enabling her to make long jumps without a running start and granting a +4 bonus on the jump (see the skill description, page 77 of the Player's Handbook). This ability can be used only if she is wearing no armor and is carrying no more than a light load.
Acrobatics (Ex)	KEY:Acrobatics ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 6th level, a ninja gains a +2 bonus on Climb, Jump, and Tumble checks. This bonus increases to +4 at 12th level and +6 at 18th level.
Ki Dodge (Su)	KEY:Ki Dodge ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 6th level and higher, a ninja can spend one daily use of her ki power to cause an attack against her to miss when it might otherwise hit. When a ninja activates this ability, her outline shifts and wavers, granting her concealment (20% miss chance) against all attacks for 1 round. Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. See invisibility has no effect on concealment granted by the ki dodge ability, but true seeing negates the miss chance. This concealment does not stack with that caused by other effects that grant concealment or by spells such as blink or displacement.
Speed Climb (Ex)	KEY:Speed Climb ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A ninja of 7th level or higher can scramble up or down walls and slopes with great speed. She can climb at her speed as a move action with no penalty; however, she must begin and end the round on a horizontal surface (such as the ground or a rooftop). If she does not end her movement on a horizontal surface, she falls, taking falling damage as appropriate for her distance above the ground. A ninja needs only one free hand to use this ability. This ability can be used only if a ninja is wearing no armor and is carrying no more than a light load.
Ghost Strike (Su)	KEY:Ghost Strike ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 8th level and higher, a ninja can spend one daily use of her ki power to strike incorporeal and ethereal creatures as if they were corporeal. She also can use this ability to strike foes on the Material Plane normally while ethereal (for example, while using her ghost step ability). Activating the ghost strike ability is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. It affects the next attack made by the ninja, as long as that attack is made before the end of her next turn.
Improved Poison Use (Ex)	KEY:Improved Poison Use ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 9th level, a ninja can apply poison to a weapon as a move action. (Normally, applying a poison is a standard action, like applying an oil.)
Evasion (Ex)	KEY:Evasion ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 12th level, a ninja can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful Reflex save. (See the monk class feature, page 41 of the Player's Handbook.) A ninja's use of evasion differs slightly from a monk's use in that a ninja can use evasion only if she is wearing no armor and is carrying no more than a light load.
Ghost Mind (Su)	KEY:Ghost Mind ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 14th level, a ninja gains a special resistance to spells of the scrying subschool. To detect or see a ninja with such a spell, the caster must make a caster level check (DC 20 + the ninja's class level). In the case of scrying spells (such as arcane eye) that scan the ninja's area, a failed check indicates that the spell works but the ninja simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts targeted specifically at the ninja do not work at all if the check fails.
Ghost Sight (Su)	KEY:Ghost Sight ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 16th level and higher, a ninja can see invisible and ethereal creatures as easily as she sees material creatures and objects.
Greater Ki Dodge (Su)	KEY:Greater Ki Dodge ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 18th level, a ninja's ki dodge ability grants total concealment (50% miss chance).
Ghost Walk (Su)	KEY:Ghost Walk ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 20th-level ninja can spend two daily uses of her ki power to enter the Ethereal Plane for an extended period of time. This ability functions as the ethereal jaunt spell with a caster level equal to the ninja's class level.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Scout	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ScoutClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Scouts are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the handaxe, throwing axe, short sword, and shortbow.

Skirmish (Ex)			KEY:Skirmish ~ Scout				SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ScoutClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:[Skirmish +%1d%2]|SkirmishDice|SkirmishDieSize	DESC:AC Bonus +%1|SkirmishACBonus|PREVARGTEQ:SkirmishACBonus,1	DESC:A scout relies on mobility to deal extra damage and improve her defense. She deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all attacks she makes during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The extra damage applies only to attacks taken during the scout's turn. This extra damage increases by 1d6 for every four levels gained above 1st (2d6 at 5th, 3d6 at 9th, 4d6 at 13th, and 5d6 at 17th level). The extra damage only applies against living creatures that have a discernible anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are not vulnerable to this additional damage. The scout must be able to see the target well eough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Scouts can apply this extra damage to ranged attacks made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within 30 feet. At 3rd level, a scout gains a +1 competence bonus to Armor Class during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The bonus applies as soon as the scout has moved 10 feet, and lasts until the start of her next turn. This bonus improves by 1 for every four levels gained above 3rd (+2 at 7th, +3 at 11th, +4 at 15th, and +5 at 19th level). A scout loses this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. If she gains the skirmish ability from another class, the bonuses stack.
