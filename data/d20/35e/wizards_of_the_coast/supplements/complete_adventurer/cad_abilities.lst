Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Ninjas are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, kama, kukri, nunchaku, sai, shortbow, short sword, shuriken, and siangham. Ninjas are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.		AUTO:WEAPONPROF|TYPE=SIMPLE|Crossbow(Hand)|Kama|Kukri|Nunchaku|Sai|Shortbow|Sword(Short)|Shuriken|Siangham
AC Bonus (Ex)			KEY:AC Bonus ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A ninja is highly trained at dodging blows, and she has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks. When unarmored and unencumbered, a ninja adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her Armor Class. This ability does not stack with the monk's AC bonus ability (a ninja with levels of monk does not add the bonus twice). In addition, a ninja gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five ninja levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level). These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when a ninja is flat-footed. The character loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.
Ki Power (Su)			KEY:Ki Power ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A ninja can channel her ki to manifest special powers of stealth and mobility. She can use her ki powers a number of times per day equal to one-half her class level (minimum 1) plus her Wisdom bonus (if any). Ki powers can be used only if a ninja is wearing no armor and is unencumbered. As long as a ninja's ki pool isn't empty (that is, as long as she has at least one daily use remaining), she gains a +2 bonus on her Will saves. A ninja's ki powers are ghost step, ki dodge, ghost strike, greater ki dodge, and ghost walk. Each power is described under a separate entry below.
Sudden Strike (Ex)		KEY:Sudden Strike ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:If a ninja can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Whenever a ninja's target is denied a Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the ninja deals an extra 1d6 points of damage with her attack. This extra damage increases by 1d6 points for every two ninja levels thereafter. A ninja can't use sudden strike when flanking an opponent unless that opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sudden strikes. A ninja can't make a sudden strike while striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are out of reach. A ninja can't use sudden strike to deliver nonlethal damage. Weapons capable of dealing only nonlethal damage don't deal extra damage when used as part of a sudden strike. The extra damage from the sudden strike ability stacks with the extra damage from sneak attack whenever both would apply to the same target.
Trapfinding (Ex)			KEY:Trapfinding ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A ninja can use the Search skill to locate traps with a DC higher than 20, and she can use Disable Device to bypass a trap or disarm magic traps. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player's Handbook.
Ghost Step (Su)			KEY:Ghost Step ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a ninja can spend one daily use of her ki power to become invisible for 1 round. Using this ability is a swift action (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137) that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 10th level, a ninja can become ethereal when using ghost step instead of becoming invisible.
Poison Use (Ex)			KEY:Poison Use ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, a ninja never risks accidentally poisoning herself when applying poison to a weapon.
Great Leap (Su)			KEY:Great Leap ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level and higher, a ninja always makes Jump checks as if she were running and had the Run feat, enabling her to make long jumps without a running start and granting a +4 bonus on the jump (see the skill description, page 77 of the Player's Handbook). This ability can be used only if she is wearing no armor and is carrying no more than a light load.
Acrobatics (Ex)			KEY:Acrobatics ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 6th level, a ninja gains a +2 bonus on Climb, Jump, and Tumble checks. This bonus increases to +4 at 12th level and +6 at 18th level.
Ki Dodge (Su)			KEY:Ki Dodge ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 6th level and higher, a ninja can spend one daily use of her ki power to cause an attack against her to miss when it might otherwise hit. When a ninja activates this ability, her outline shifts and wavers, granting her concealment (20%% miss chance) against all attacks for 1 round. Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. See invisibility has no effect on concealment granted by the ki dodge ability, but true seeing negates the miss chance. This concealment does not stack with that caused by other effects that grant concealment or by spells such as blink or displacement.
Speed Climb (Ex)			KEY:Speed Climb ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A ninja of 7th level or higher can scramble up or down walls and slopes with great speed. She can climb at her speed as a move action with no penalty; however, she must begin and end the round on a horizontal surface (such as the ground or a rooftop). If she does not end her movement on a horizontal surface, she falls, taking falling damage as appropriate for her distance above the ground. A ninja needs only one free hand to use this ability. This ability can be used only if a ninja is wearing no armor and is carrying no more than a light load.
Ghost Strike (Su)			KEY:Ghost Strike ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 8th level and higher, a ninja can spend one daily use of her ki power to strike incorporeal and ethereal creatures as if they were corporeal. She also can use this ability to strike foes on the Material Plane normally while ethereal (for example, while using her ghost step ability). Activating the ghost strike ability is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. It affects the next attack made by the ninja, as long as that attack is made before the end of her next turn.
Improved Poison Use (Ex)	KEY:Improved Poison Use ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 9th level, a ninja can apply poison to a weapon as a move action. (Normally, applying a poison is a standard action, like applying an oil.)
Evasion (Ex)			KEY:Evasion ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 12th level, a ninja can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful Reflex save. (See the monk class feature, page 41 of the Player's Handbook.) A ninja's use of evasion differs slightly from a monk's use in that a ninja can use evasion only if she is wearing no armor and is carrying no more than a light load.
Ghost Mind (Su)			KEY:Ghost Mind ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 14th level, a ninja gains a special resistance to spells of the scrying subschool. To detect or see a ninja with such a spell, the caster must make a caster level check (DC 20 + the ninja's class level). In the case of scrying spells (such as arcane eye) that scan the ninja's area, a failed check indicates that the spell works but the ninja simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts targeted specifically at the ninja do not work at all if the check fails.
Ghost Sight (Su)			KEY:Ghost Sight ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 16th level and higher, a ninja can see invisible and ethereal creatures as easily as she sees material creatures and objects.
Greater Ki Dodge (Su)		KEY:Greater Ki Dodge ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 18th level, a ninja's ki dodge ability grants total concealment (50%% miss chance).
Ghost Walk (Su)			KEY:Ghost Walk ~ Ninja	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.NinjaClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 20th-level ninja can spend two daily uses of her ki power to enter the Ethereal Plane for an extended period of time. This ability functions as the ethereal jaunt spell with a caster level equal to the ninja's class level.

###Block: Scout
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Scout	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ScoutClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Scouts are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the handaxe, throwing axe, short sword, and shortbow.

She deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all attacks she makes during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The extra damage applies only to attacks taken during the scout's turn. This extra damage increases by 1d6 for every four levels gained above 1st (2d6 at 5th, 3d6 at 9th, 4d6 at 13th, and 5d6 at 17th level). The extra damage only applies against living creatures that have a discernible anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are not vulnerable to this additional damage. The scout must be able to see the target well eough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Scouts can apply this extra damage to ranged attacks made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within 30 feet. At 3rd level, a scout gains a +1 competence bonus to Armor Class during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The bonus applies as soon as the scout has moved 10 feet, and lasts until the start of her next turn. This bonus improves by 1 for every four levels gained above 3rd (+2 at 7th, +3 at 11th, +4 at 15th, and +5 at 19th level). A scout loses this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. If she gains the skirmish ability from another class, the bonuses stack.

See the barbarian class feature, page 26 of the Player's Handbook.
Fast Movement (Ex)		KEY:Fast Movement ~ Scout			SOURCEPAGE:p.12	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ScoutClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, a scout's gains a +10 foot enhancement bonus to her base land speed. At 11th level, this bonus increases to +20 feet. See the monk class feature, page 41 of the Player's Handbook. A scout loses this benefit when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.	BONUS:MOVEADD|TYPE.Walk|FastMovementBonus
Trackless Step (Ex)		KEY:Trackless Step ~ Scout			SOURCEPAGE:p.13	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ScoutClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a scout cannot be tracked in natural surroundings. See the druid class feature, page 36 of the Player's Handbook.

Flawless Stride (Ex)		KEY:Flawless Stride ~ Scout			SOURCEPAGE:p.13	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ScoutClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 6th level, a scout can move through any sort of terrain that slows movement (such as undergrowth, rubble, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. This ability does not let her move more quickly through terrain that requires a Climb or Swim check to navigate, nor can she move more quickly through terrain or undergrowth that has been magically manipulated to impede motion. A scout loses this benefit when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.
Camouflage (Ex)			KEY:Camouflage ~ Scout				SOURCEPAGE:p.13	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ScoutClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 8th level, a scout can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain. See the ranger class feature, page 48 of the Player's Handbook. She loses this benefit when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.
Blindsense (Ex)			KEY:Blindsense ~ Scout				SOURCEPAGE:p.13	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ScoutClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, a scout gains the blindsense ability out to 30 feet. This ability functions as described on page 306 of the Monster Manual.	BONUS:VAR|BlindsenseRange|30
Hide in Plain Sight (Ex)	KEY:Hide in Plain Sight ~ Scout		SOURCEPAGE:p.13	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ScoutClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 14th level, a scout can use the Hide skill in natural terrain even while being observed. See the ranger class feature, page 48 of the Player's Handbook. A scout loses this benefit when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.
Free Movement (Ex)		KEY:Free Movement ~ Scout			SOURCEPAGE:p.13	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ScoutClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 18th level and higher, a scout can slip out of bonds, grapples, and even the effects of confining spells easily. This ability duplicates the effect of a freedom of movement spell, except that it is always active. A scout loses this benefit when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.
Blindsight (Ex)			KEY:Blindsight ~ Scout				SOURCEPAGE:p.13	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.ScoutClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 20th-level scout gains the blindsight ability out to 30 feet. Her senses become so acute that she can maneuver and fight flawlessly even in total darkness. Invisibility, darkness, and most kinds of concealment are irrelevant, though the scout must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern it.	BONUS:VAR|BlindsightRange|30

###Block: Spellthief
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Spellthief	SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Spellthieves are proficient with all simple weapons and with light armor but not with shields. Because the somatic components required for spellthief spells are simple, a spellthief can cast spellthief spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, a spellthief wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure (see page 123 of the Player's Handbook) if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass spellthief still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes, including those stolen from arcane casters (see the steal spell ability, below).
Sneak Attack (Ex)			KEY:Sneak Attack ~ Spellthief				SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A spellthief deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when fl anking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 5th level, 3d6 points at 9th level, 4d6 points at 13th level, and 5d6 points at 17th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player's Handbook. If a spellthief gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack.
Steal Spell (Su)			KEY:Steal Spell ~ Spellthief				SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A spellthief can siphon spell energy away from his target and use it himself. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a successful sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead steal a spell, or the potential to cast a specific known spell, from his target. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell with a touch as a standard action. The target of a steal spell attack loses one 0-level or 1st-level spell from memory if she prepares spells ahead of time, or one 0-level or 1st-level spell slot if she is a spontaneous caster. A spontaneous caster also loses the ability to cast the stolen spell for 1 minute. If the target has no spells prepared (or has no remaining spell slots, if she is a spontaneous caster), this ability has no effect. A spellthief can choose which spell to steal; otherwise, the DM determines the stolen spell randomly. If a spellthief tries to steal a spell that isn't available, the stolen spell (or spell slot) is determined randomly from among those the target has available. For example, a 1st-level spellthief who uses this ability against a 1st-level sorcerer could choose to steal magic missile. Assuming the sorcerer knew that spell, a successful steal spell attack would eliminate one 1st-level spell slot and temporarily prevent her from casting magic missile. If the same spellthief stole magic missile from a wizard who had it prepared, the wizard would lose one prepared magic missile spell (but wouldn't lose any other magic missile spells she might also have prepared). After stealing a spell, a spellthief can cast the spell himself on a subsequent turn. Treat the spell as if it were cast by the original owner of the spell for the purpose of determining caster level, save DC, and so forth. A spellthief can cast this spell even if he doesn't have the minimum ability score normally required to cast a spell of that level. The spellthief must supply the same components (including verbal, somatic, material, XP, and any focus) required for the stolen spell. Alternatively, a spellthief of 4th level or higher can use the stolen spell power to cast any spellthief spell that he knows of the same level or lower (effectively, this gives the spellthief one free casting of a known spell). A spellthief must cast a stolen spell (or use its energy to cast one of his own spells) within 1 hour of stealing it; otherwise, the extra spell energy fades harmlessly away. As a spellthief gains levels, he can choose to steal higher-level spells. At 4th level, he can steal spells of up to 2nd level, and for every two levels gained after 4th, the maximum spell level stolen increases by one (up to a maximum of 9th-level spells at 18th level). At any one time, a spellthief can possess a maximum number of stolen spell levels equal to his class level (treat 0-level spells as 1/2 level for this purpose). For instance, a 4th-level spellthief can have two stolen 2nd-level spells, or one 2nd-level spell and two 1st-level spells, or any other combination of 0-level, 1st-level, and 2nd-level spells totaling four levels. If he steals a spell that would cause him to exceed this limit, he must choose to lose stolen spells sufficient to reduce his total number of stolen spell levels to no more than his maximum. A spellthief can't apply metamagic feats or other effects to the stolen spell unless the specific spell stolen was prepared with such an effect. For example, a spellthief of 6th level or higher could steal a wizard's empowered magic missile, but only if he specifically chose to steal empowered magic missile. If he chose to steal an unmodified magic missile, he couldn't steal an empowered magic missile, a silent magic missile, or any other metamagic form of the spell. A spellthief couldn't steal an empowered magic missile from a sorcerer, since the sorcerer applies metamagic effects upon casting and thus has no prepared empowered magic missile spell. This ability works only against spells. It has no effect on psionic powers or spell-like abilities (but see the steal spell-like ability class feature, below).
Trapfinding (Ex)			KEY:Trapfinding ~ Spellthief				SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A spellthief can use the Search skill to locate traps with a DC higher than 20, and he can use Disable Device to bypass a trap or disarm magic traps. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player's Handbook.
Detect Magic (Sp)			KEY:Detect Magic ~ Spellthief				SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A spellthief of 2nd level or higher can use detect magic a number of times per day equal to his Charisma bonus, if any (minimum 1). His caster level is equal to his spellthief class level.
Spellgrace (Su)			KEY:Spellgrace ~ Spellthief				SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A spellthief of 2nd level or higher gains a +1 competence bonus on his saves against spells. This bonus improves to +2 at 11th level and to +3 at 20th level.
Steal Spell Effect (Su)		KEY:Steal Spell Effect ~ Spellthief			SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a spellthief can siphon an active spell effect from another creature. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead gain the effect of a single spell affecting the target. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell effect with a touch as a standard action. The spellthief can choose which spell effect to steal; otherwise, the DM determines the stolen spell effect randomly. If a spellthief tries to steal a spell effect that isn't present, the stolen spell effect is determined randomly from among those currently in effect on the target. A spellthief can't steal a spell effect if its caster level exceeds his class level + his Charisma modifier. Upon stealing a spell effect, a spellthief gains the stolen effect (and the original creature loses that effect) for 1 minute per class level (or until the spell's duration expires, whichever comes first). If the spell effect's duration hasn't expired by this time, the spell effect returns to the creature that originally benefited from it. A spellthief can steal the effect of a spell only if the spell could be cast on him by the original caster. For example, a spellthief couldn't gain the effect of an animal growth spell (unless the spellthief is of the animal type) or the effect of a shield spell (since that spell's range is personal). If a spellthief tries to steal the effect of a spell not allowed to him, the effect is still suppressed on the original target of the spell for 1 minute per spellthief class level. This ability does not work on spell effects that are immune to dispel magic (such as bestow curse).
Steal Energy Resistance (Su)	KEY:Steal Energy Resistance ~ Spellthief		SOURCEPAGE:p.18	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a spellthief can siphon off some or all of a target's resistance to an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). A spellthief who hits an opponent with a successful sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead temporarily gain resistance 10 to an energy type to which his target is resistant (or immune). If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal energy resistance with a touch as a standard action. Simultaneously, the target creature's resistance to that energy type is reduced by 10 (to a minimum of 0). A creature with immunity to an energy type retains that immunity. If his target has more than one type of resistance to energy, a spellthief can choose which kind to steal; otherwise, the DM determines the stolen resistance randomly from among those possessed by the target. If a spellthief chooses to steal a type of resistance that the target doesn't possess, the stolen type of resistance is determined randomly from those possessed by the target. The resistance a spellthief gains from using this ability lasts for 1 minute. If the resistance is derived from a temporary effect (such as a spell), the stolen resistance disappears when the effect expires. A spellthief can use this ability multiple times, but its effects do not stack unless they apply to different types of energy. For example, throughout a long combat, a spellthief might use this ability to gain resistance to fire and resistance to cold, but he could not use it twice on a creature that is resistant to fire to gain twice as much resistance to fire (nor to reduce the creature's resistance to fire by twice as much). At 11th level, a spellthief can steal resistance 20 to an energy type by using this ability, and at 19th level he can steal resistance 30 to an energy type.
Spells				KEY:Spells ~ Spellthief					SOURCEPAGE:p.19	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a spellthief gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells, which are drawn from a subset of the sorcerer/wizard spell list (see below). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, just as a sorcerer can (see page 54 of the Player's Handbook). To learn or cast a spell, a spellthief must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, Cha 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so on). The DC for a saving throw against a spellthief's spell is 10 + spell level + spellthief's Cha modifier. Like other spellcasters, a spellthief can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-3: The Spellthief. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-1, page 8 of the Player's Handbook). When Table 1-3 indicates that a spellthief gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 4th-level spellthief), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. A spellthief's selection of spells is extremely limited. A spellthief begins play knowing no spells but gains one or more new spells at certain levels, as indicated on Table 1-4: Spellthief Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, his Charisma does not affect the number of spells he knows; the numbers on Table 1-4 are fixed.) A spellthief can learn any sorcerer/wizard spell from the following schools: abjuration, divination, enchantment, illusion, and transmutation. No other sorcerer/wizard spells are on the spellthief's class spell list. Upon reaching 12th level, and at every third spellthief level after that (15th and 18th), a spellthief can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the spellthief "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level spellthief spell that the spellthief can cast. For instance, upon reaching 12th level, a spellthief could trade in a single 1st-level spell for a different 1st-level spell. A spellthief can swap only a single spell at any given level, and he must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. At 4th level and higher, a spellthief's caster level for spells is one-half his spellthief level.
Steal Spell-Like Ability (Su)	KEY:Steal Spell-Like Ability ~ Spellthief		SOURCEPAGE:p.19	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level and higher, a spellthief can use a sneak attack to temporarily steal a creature's spell-like ability. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead gain one use of one of the target's spell-like abilities. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell-like ability with a touch as a standard action. This spell-like ability can originate from the target's class, race, template, or any other source, and can be of any level up to a maximum of one-third the spellthief's class level. A spellthief can select a specific spell-like ability to steal; otherwise, the DM chooses the ability at random. If the ability has a limited number of uses per day, the target must have at least one such use left, or the spellthief can't steal the ability. If the target can't use its ability at the present time (such as a summoned demon's summon ability), the spellthief can't steal it. A spellthief can use a stolen spell-like ability once. For all purposes (caster level, save DC, and so on), treat the spell-like ability as if it were being used by the original possessor of the ability. A spellthief must use the stolen spell-like ability within 1 minute of acquiring it, or it is lost harmlessly. Until the spellthief uses the ability (or until the minute elapses), the target cannot use the stolen ability.
Absorb Spell (Su)			KEY:Absorb Spell ~ Spellthief				SOURCEPAGE:p.19	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 7th level, if a spellthief makes a successful save against a spell that targets him, he can attempt to absorb the spell energy for later use. This ability affects only spells that have the spellthief as a target, not effect or area spells. A spellthief can't absorb a spell of a higher spell level than he could steal with his steal spell ability (see above). To absorb a spell that targets him, a spellthief must succeed on a level check (1d20 + spellthief class level) against a DC of 10 + the spell's caster level. Failure indicates that the spell has its normal effect. Success means that the spellthief suffers no effect from the spell and can cast the spell later (or use its energy to cast one of his own spells known) as if he had stolen the spell with his steal spell ability. His normal limit of total spell levels stolen still applies. At 20th level or higher, a spellthief can choose to use the stolen spell energy as an immediate action (see page 137), either to recast the original spell or to cast one of his own spells known using the stolen spell energy.
Arcane Sight (Sp)			KEY:Arcane Sight ~ Spellthief				SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 9th level, a spellthief can use arcane sight as a swift action (see page 137) a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1). His caster level is equal to his spellthief class level.
Discover Spells (Ex)		KEY:Discover Spells ~ Spellthief			SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A spellthief of 13th level or higher who steals a spell from a spellcaster with his steal spell ability automatically learns the names of all other spells prepared or known by the spellcaster that are of the same spell level as the stolen spell. This knowledge allows the spellthief to better choose which spells to steal on subsequent attacks. For example, a 13th-level spellthief who steals disintegrate from an enemy sorcerer would also discover the names of all other 6th-level spells known by that sorcerer.
Steal Spell Resistance (Su)	KEY:Steal Spell Resistance ~ Spellthief		SOURCEPAGE:p.20	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeature.SpellthiefClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 15th level, a spellthief can use a sneak attack to temporarily steal some or all of a creature's spell resistance. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo 3d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead reduce the target's spell resistance by 5. The spellthief also gains spell resistance equal to 5 + his class level (up to a maximum value equal to the original spell resistance of the target). If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal spell resistance with a touch as a standard action. The stolen spell resistance benefits the spellthief for a number of rounds equal to the spellthief's Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round) and then returns to the target creature. If the spell resistance is derived from a temporary effect (such as a spell), the stolen spell resistance disappears when the effect elapses. A spellthief can't use this ability on the same creature again until the creature's stolen spell resistance returns.
