SOURCEPAGE:p.106	BENEFIT:As a free action, you can use Sense Motive to assess the challenge presented by a single opponent in relationship to your own level/Hit Dice (see the assess opponent option under the Sense Motive skill, page 102).

SOURCEPAGE:p.106	BENEFIT:Once per day, you can reroll an initiative check you have just made. You use the better of your two rolls. You must decide to reroll before the round starts.

Your extensive training with two weapons allows you to attack with both while moving through a chaotic combat or fighting a running battle.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.108	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can make a melee attack with your primary weapon and your off-hand weapon. Both attacks use the same attack roll to determine success, using the worse of the two weapons' attack modifiers. If you are using a one-handed or light weapon in your primary hand and a light weapon in your off hand, you take a -4 penalty on this attack roll; otherwise you take a -10 penalty.
Expert Tactician				TYPE:General																	PREATT:2										PREFEAT:1,Combat Reflexes																																											PRESTAT:1,DEX=13								DESC:Your tactical skills work to your advantage.

SOURCEPAGE:p.110	BENEFIT:You can alter any of your mind-affecting bardic music abilities (or similar Perform-based abilities from other classes) so that they influence only plant creatures instead of other creatures. However, plants receive a +5 bonus on Will saves against any of these effects.
Hear the Unseen				TYPE:General.Scout																											PREFEAT:1,Blind Fight																										PRESKILL:1,Listen=5																									DESC:Your sense of hearing is so acute that you can partially pinpoint an opponent's location by sound, allowing you to strike even if the opponent is concealed or displaced.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.110	BENEFIT:As a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, you can attempt a DC 25 Listen check. If successful, you can pinpoint the location of all foes within 30 feet, as long as you have line of effect to them. This benefit does not eliminate the normal miss chance for fighting foes with concealment, but it ensures that you can target the correct square with your attacks.

SOURCEPAGE:p.110	BENEFIT:You can combine a jump with a charge against an opponent.

SOURCEPAGE:p.112	BENEFIT:You can produce music or poetics so subtly that opponents do not notice it, yet your allies still gain all the usual benefits from your bardic music.
