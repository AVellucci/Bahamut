# Vow of Poverty Abilities
AC Bonus				KEY:AC Bonus ~ Vow of Poverty				SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A 1st-level ascetic receives a +4 exalted bonus to his Armor Class. The bonus increases to +5 at 3rd level, and thereafter increases by +1 for each 3 character levels. This bonus does not apply to touch attacks and does not hinder incorporeal touch attacks. Brilliant energy weapons, however, do not ignore this bonus. This does not stack with an armor bonus.

Bonus Exalted Feats		KEY:Bonus Exalted Feats ~ Vow of Poverty		SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:At 1st level, an ascetic gets a bonus exalted feat, and another bonus feat at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Unlike the other benefits of a vow of poverty, a character does not gain these bonus feats retroactively when he takes the Vow of Poverty feat; he only gains those bonus feats that apply for the levels he gains after swearing his vow. Thus, the bonus feat gained at 1st level is available only to humans who take both Sacred Vow and Vow of Poverty at 1st level.
Endure Elements			KEY:Endure Elements ~ Vow of Poverty		SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A 3rd-level ascetic is immune to the effects of being in a hot or cold environment. He can exist comfortably in conditions between -50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves (as described in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Exalted Strike			KEY:Exalted Strike ~ Vow of Poverty			SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 4th level, an ascetic gains a +1 enhancement bonus on all his attack and damage rolls. In effect, any weapon the character wields becomes a +1 magic weapon, and can overcome the damage reduction of a creature as though it were a magic weapon. This enhancement bonus rises to +2 at 10th level, to +3 at 14th level, to +4 at 17th level, and to +5 at 20th level. At 10th level, any weapon damage the character deals is also considered to be good-aligned, so that it can bypass the damage reduction of some evil outsiders.

# Class Abilities

###Block: Anointed Knight
50
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An anointed knight is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all types of armor, and shields.
Anoint Self (Su): An anointed knight concocts a magic oil with which to anoint herself, at a cost of 100 gp (for alchemical components). She can make only one dose of the oil each time this class feature is gained (at 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th level). Creating the oil takes 1 hour. Applying the oil is a ceremony that takes 8 hours. Once the oil is applied, the anointed knight permanently gains a new supernatural ability chosen from the accompanying list. Her level plus Charisma modifier determines the choices available to her (the highest-numbered choice possible, or any lower one). An anointed knight cannot choose an ability more than once, nor can she replace one ability with another once the choice is made.
51
# Anoint Self
2 or lower Holy Sight: The knight gains the Alertness feat.
3-4 Celestial Strategy: The knight gains the Combat Reflexes feat.
5-6 Unbroken Flesh: The knight gains damage reduction 3/-.
7-8 Divine Clarity: The knight's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score improves by 1.
9 Call to Battle: Three times per day, the knight gains an extra +3 bonus on her attack roll when charging.
10 Deep Strike: Three times per day, on a successful attack, the knight deals an extra 2d6 points of damage.
11+ Inspired Strike: Three times per day, the knight can take a single extra attack at her highest attack bonus as a free action.
#
Anoint Ancestral Weapon (Su): An anointed knight concocts a magic oil with which to coat her ancestral weapon, at a cost of 100 gp (for alchemical components). She can make only one dose of the oil each time this class feature is gained (at 2nd, 5th, and 8th level). If the oil is applied to a weapon other than the anointed knight's ancestral weapon, nothing happens and the oil is wasted. Creating the oil takes 1 hour. Applying the oil is a ceremony that takes 8 hours. Once the oil is applied, the ancestral weapon permanently gains a new supernatural ability chosen from the accompanying list. The knight's level plus Charisma modifier determines the choices available to her (the highest-numbered choice possible, or any lower one). An anointed knight cannot choose an ability more than once, nor can she replace one ability with another once the choice is made.
# Anoint Ancestral Weapon
3 or lower Good Weapon: The ancestral weapon deals 1d6 points of damage per round to any evil creature that holds or wields it. The weapon also becomes a good-aligned weapon.
4-6 Sunder Resistance: The ancestral weapon gains 10 points of hardness.
7-8 Unicorn's Blood: Any evil creature wounded by the weapon must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or suffer the weakening effects of unicorn blood.1
9 Impervious: The ancestral weapon gains an extra 50 hp.
10+ Sentience: The ancestral weapon becomes an intelligent item, with the same alignment as the knight.
#
Bonus Feat: At 3rd level, and again at 6th and 9th level, the anointed knight gains a bonus feat. This feat must be drawn from the following feats, and the knight must meet all the prerequisites for it: Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Diehard, Dodge, Endurance, Exalted Smite*, Great Cleave, Holy Subdual*, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Overrun, Improved Sunder, Improved Trip, Mobility, Power Attack, Sanctify Martial Strike*, Sanctify Weapon*, Spring Attack, Subduing Strike*, Whirlwind Attack.

52
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Apostles of peace gain no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.
As part of their sacred vows, apostles of peace forswear the
use of armor, though they may wear magic items that protect
them (such as a ring of protection or bracers of armor). An apostle of
peace who wears any armor is unable to cast apostle of
peace spells or use any of his supernatural
class abilities while doing so and for 24
hours thereafter.
Spells: An apostle of peace has the ability to
cast a number of divine spells. To cast an apostle
of peace spell, the apostle must have a Wisdom
score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an apostle
with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast
these spells. Apostle of peace bonus spells are
based on Wisdom, and saving
throws against these spells have a
DC of 10 + spell level + the
apostle of peace's Wisdom
modifier. When the apostle of
peace gets 0 spells per day of a
given spell level (for instance,
2nd-level spells for a 2nd-level
apostle), he gains
only the bonus
spells he would
be entitled to
based on his
Wisdom score for
that spell level. The
apostle of peace's spell list appears below. An
apostle of peace prepares and casts spells just as a
cleric does.
To determine the caster level of an apostle of peace,
add the character's apostle levels to one-half of his caster
levels in other spellcasting classes.
Spontaneous Casting: An apostle of
peace can channel stored spell energy
into healing spells that the apostle did
not prepare ahead of time. An apostle can
"lose" any prepared apostle spell in
order to cast any cure spell of the
same spell level or lower (a cure spell
is any spell with "cure" in its name).
Turn Undead (Su): An apostle of peace can turn
undead as a good cleric of his apostle of peace level
would. If he is also a cleric (or paladin), he adds his apostle levels
to his effective cleric levels to determine his turning capability.
Pacifying Touch (Su): At 2nd level, an apostle of peace gains
the ability to pacify hostile or angry creatures by touch. The
effect is similar to the calm emotions spell. The apostle can affect
only a single target with each use of the ability, and must touch
the target. A touched creature receives no saving throw and
spell resistance does not apply. The pacifying touch does not
suppress positive emotions, just anger, rage, and hostility. The
apostle of peace can make a level check as if casting dispel magic,
using his character level as his caster level, to dispel certain
mind-affecting spells affecting the target. The pacifying touch
can only dispel spells that incite violent emotions in the target,
such as fear or rage.
Censure Fiends (Su): A 4rd-level apostle of peace can censure
fiends, much as good clerics turn undead. Channeling holy
power from the celestial planes, he can make demons, devils,
and other outsiders with the evil subtype recoil. Make a
Charisma check for the apostle and consult
Table 8-9 in the Player's Handbook,
using the apostle's character
level to determine the most
powerful fiend he can censure. Roll 2d6
+ the apostle of peace's level + his Charisma
modifier for censuring damage. Using both
the apostle's character level and his class level
in this manner means that he is more likely to
affect a single powerful fiend, but unlikely to
censure more than one of them.
A censured fiend is stunned by the apostle's
holy power for 1d4+1 rounds. If an apostle
of peace attacks a censured fiend, the
stunning ends immediately and the fiend
can act normally on its next turn.
If the apostle of peace's character level is
at least twice the fiend's Hit Dice, he banishes
the affected fiend back to its home
plane. An apostle of peace can make a number of
censuring attempts per day equal to 3 + his
Charisma modifier.
These attempts
are separate from any attempts to
turn undead.

###Block: Beloved of Valarian
54

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A beloved of Valarian is
proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, and
small shields.
Spells: A beloved of Valarian has the ability to cast a small
number of divine spells. To cast a beloved of Valarian spell, the
beloved must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's
level, so a beloved of Valarian with a Wisdom of 10 or lower
cannot cast these spells. Beloved of Valarian bonus spells are
based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a
DC of 10 + spell level + the beloved's Wisdom modifier. When
the beloved of Valarian gets 0 spells of a given spell level (for
instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st level beloved of Valarian), she
gets only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her
Wisdom score for that spell level.
The beloved of Valarian's spell list appears below. A beloved of
Valarian prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a
beloved cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).
Call Unicorn (Su): A beloved of Valarian can call a unicorn
to her side. See the Monster Manual for the unicorn's statistics.
The unicorn appears instantly and serves the character for
life, provided she remains chaste and of good alignment. The
unicorn may be dismissed at any time, although a character
cannot call another until she gains a level in the beloved of
Valarian class. If the unicorn should die before its rider, the
character may call another unicorn companion when she gains
a new level in this class.
A beloved of Valarian can have no more than one unicorn
companion at any given time.
A beloved of Valarian can assign her unicorn companion to
undertake different types of tasks. Particularly useful as a
mount, the unicorn typically will not undergo a quest or otherwise
take on complex burdens without the supervision of the
beloved of Valarian.
Telepathic Bond (Su): A beloved of Valarian can communicate
telepathically with her unicorn companion. This bond
remains in effect unless the character is separated from her unicorn
by a number of miles equal to 100 + the beloved's character
level.
At 6th level, a Valarian's beloved can communicate telepathically
with any animal native to her unicorn companion's home
forest.
Timelessness (Su): Unicorns age very slowly, living for
thousands of years. As long as she remains faithful to Valarian
and has a unicorn companion serving her, a beloved of Valarian
ages just as slowly, the aging process essentially halted.
Ethereal Jaunt (Sp): At 2nd level, once per day, a beloved of
Valarian and her equipment may become ethereal, as the ethereal
jaunt spell cast by a sorcerer of the beloved's character level. If
the beloved of Valarian is astride her unicorn companion, it is
also affected by this ability. However, if the beloved of Valarian
dismounts or the two otherwise become separated before the
ethereal jaunt expires, the unicorn companion instantly returns
to the Material Plane.
Forest Dweller (Ex):Time spent in the forest alters a beloved
of Valarian's physiology at 3rd level. She gains a +2 racial bonus
on Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival checks.
Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a beloved of
Valarian can react to danger before her senses would normally
allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even
when caught flat-footed.
If the beloved of Valarian already has uncanny dodge from a
different class (rogue, for example), she gains improved
uncanny dodge instead; she cannot be flanked except by a
rogue who has at least four more rogue levels than she has in
this prestige class.
As long as the beloved of Valarian is riding her unicorn companion,
it gains the benefit of this ability as well.
Call Celestial Charger (Su): At 6th level, a beloved of Valarian
can call a celestial unicorn-also known as a celestial charger-
to her side. See the Unicorn entry in the Monster Manual for the
celestial charger's statistics. If the beloved of Valarian already has
a unicorn companion, Valarian transforms it into a celestial
charger instead of sending his beloved a new companion.
Nature's Understanding (Ex): At 7th level, a beloved of
Valarian gains a +2 insight bonus on Handle Animal, Knowledge
(nature), and Survival checks.
Holy Smite (Sp): Starting at 8th level, once per day, a beloved
of Valarian can cast holy smite as a cleric of her class level. She
may choose to deal nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage
with the holy smite.
Wood Repulsion (Su): Weapons partially or wholly fashioned
from wood have a harder time striking a beloved of Valarian,
as though deflected by some invisible barrier. Attacks made
with such weapons take a -2 penalty. As long as the beloved of
Valarian is riding her unicorn companion, it gains the benefit of
this ability as well.
Mass Baleful Polymorph (Sp): At 10th level, once per day, a
beloved of Valarian can cast a special version of the baleful polymorph
spell that affects all evil creatures within 30 feet of her (as
a 10th-level druid). Affected creatures are transformed into
harmless Diminutive mammals (rabbits, squirrels, or the like) or
Fine vermin (nonthreatening spiders, centipedes, or the like).
All affected creatures are transformed into the same type of
creature. See the baleful polymorph spell description in the
Player's Handbook for details.
