# Vow of Poverty Abilities
AC Bonus				KEY:AC Bonus ~ Vow of Poverty				SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A 1st-level ascetic receives a +4 exalted bonus to his Armor Class. The bonus increases to +5 at 3rd level, and thereafter increases by +1 for each 3 character levels. This bonus does not apply to touch attacks and does not hinder incorporeal touch attacks. Brilliant energy weapons, however, do not ignore this bonus. This does not stack with an armor bonus.

Bonus Exalted Feats		KEY:Bonus Exalted Feats ~ Vow of Poverty		SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:At 1st level, an ascetic gets a bonus exalted feat, and another bonus feat at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Unlike the other benefits of a vow of poverty, a character does not gain these bonus feats retroactively when he takes the Vow of Poverty feat; he only gains those bonus feats that apply for the levels he gains after swearing his vow. Thus, the bonus feat gained at 1st level is available only to humans who take both Sacred Vow and Vow of Poverty at 1st level.
Endure Elements			KEY:Endure Elements ~ Vow of Poverty		SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A 3rd-level ascetic is immune to the effects of being in a hot or cold environment. He can exist comfortably in conditions between -50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves (as described in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Exalted Strike			KEY:Exalted Strike ~ Vow of Poverty			SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 4th level, an ascetic gains a +1 enhancement bonus on all his attack and damage rolls. In effect, any weapon the character wields becomes a +1 magic weapon, and can overcome the damage reduction of a creature as though it were a magic weapon. This enhancement bonus rises to +2 at 10th level, to +3 at 14th level, to +4 at 17th level, and to +5 at 20th level. At 10th level, any weapon damage the character deals is also considered to be good-aligned, so that it can bypass the damage reduction of some evil outsiders.
