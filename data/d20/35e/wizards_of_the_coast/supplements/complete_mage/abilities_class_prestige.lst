###Block:Nightmare Spinner Abilities
# Ability Name										Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																																																																							Source Page
Inspire Fear		KEY:Inspire Fear ~ Nightmare Spinner		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, you can create a mind-affecting fear effect that makes a living creature within 30 feet ill at ease. The target becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to your nightmare spinner class level; a successful Will save (DC 10 + your class level + your Cha modifier) halves this duration. You can use this power a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier. Multiple uses of this ability on the same creature don't stack.

Nightmare Phantasm	KEY:Nightmare Phantasm ~ Nightmare Spinner	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, when you cast a figment or glamer spell, you can choose to weave a thread of nightmare phantasm into it as a free action. The spell gains the phantasm descriptor. Each time any enemy attempts a Will save to disbelieve the affected illusion spell, a tiny portion of the spell transforms into a phantasm effect that targets that enemy. The enemy becomes shaken for 1 round (no save). This ability has no other effect on the original spell's duration or effectiveness. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier. No creature can be affected by your nightmare phantasm ability more than once in a 24-hour period. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Spirit Chill		KEY:Spirit Chill ~ Nightmare Spinner		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, creatures affected by a fear effect you cause (whether by a spell, class feature, or other effect) take nonlethal damage as well, depending on the potency of the fear created. Any creature that is shaken takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. A creature that becomes frightened takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage, while a creature that becomes panicked takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage.

Deadly Nightmare		KEY:Deadly Nightmare ~ Nightmare Spinner		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, you can create a mind-affecting fear effect that can make a living creature literally drop dead. You can target one living creature within 30 feet of you, which must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + your class level + your Cha modifier) or literally die of fright. Even if the save succeeds, the subject is panicked for 1 round. Any creature whose Hit Dice exceed twice your character level is unaffected by this power. This is a mind-affecting fear death effect. You can use this power three times per day.																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.75
