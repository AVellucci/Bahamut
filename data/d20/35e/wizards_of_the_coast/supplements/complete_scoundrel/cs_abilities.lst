###Block: Avenging Executioner
Bloody Blade (Ex)	KEY:Bloody Blade ~ Avenging Executioner	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The fury of your attack is terrifying to see. Whenever you deal sudden strike damage (see below) with a melee weapon, the target of the sudden strike and all opponents within 30 feet of you who can see the target are shaken for a number of rounds equal to your avenging executioner level. A successful Will save (DC 10 + your avenging executioner level + your Cha modifier) negates this effect. Creatures whose HD exceed your character level are not affected. Bloody blade is a mind-affecting fear ability.

25
Sudden Strike (Ex): If you can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from your attack, you can strike a vital spot for extra damage. See the ninja's sudden strike class feature in the sidebar below.
Rapid Intimidation (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, you can attempt to demoralize an opponent as a move action instead of a standard action. See the Intimidate skill (PH 77) for details. If you have the favored enemy class feature, you can add your favored enemy bonus to Intimidate checks made to demoralize foes of the chosen type (and subtype, if applicable).
Dread Blade (Ex): Starting at 4th level, you can exploit the terror you inspire to further brutalize your target. You treat shaken, frightened, or panicked creatures as flat-footed for the purpose of dealing sudden strike damage.
Bloody Murder (Ex): Starting at 5th level, if you deal enough damage with a melee attack to drop a creature (typically by reducing it to below 0 hit points or killing it), all enemies within 30 feet of you who can see the target become frightened for 1 round. A successful Will save (DC 10 + your avenging executioner level + your Cha modifier) lessens the effect to shaken. Creatures whose HD exceed your character level are not affected. Bloody murder is a mind-affecting fear ability.


###Block: Battle Trickster
28
Bonus Trick: At 1st level, and again at 3rd level, you gain a bonus skill trick for which you meet the prerequisite. These bonus tricks do not cost skill points and do not count against your maximum number of skill tricks available.
Bonus Feat: At 2nd level, you gain a bonus feat for which you meet the prerequisite. This feat must be selected from the list of fighter bonus feats.
Tricky Fighting (Ex): At 3rd level, you have mastered incorporating skill tricks into your combat routines. In any round when you perform a skill trick, you gain a +1 competence bonus on the next attack roll you make that round.

###Block: Cloaked Dancer
31
Enchanting Dance (Su): Once per day per cloaked dancer level, you can use your dance to produce supernatural effects on those who observe you. Each ability requires both a minimum cloaked dancer level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform (dance) skill to qualify; if you do not have the required number of ranks, you do not gain the enchanting dance ability until you acquire them. This ability can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor and carrying no more than a light load. Enchanting dance is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability. Starting an enchanting dance effect is a standard action. You must concentrate each round to maintain the dance; no dance can be maintained for more rounds than your cloaked dancer level + your Con modifier (minimum 1 round). The save DC for your enchanting dance effects is 10 + your cloaked dancer level + your Cha modifier. A creature can't be affected again by your enchanting dance effect for 24 hours whether or not it succeeds on the saving throw.
#
Beguiling Dance: A cloaked dancer with 10 or more ranks in Perform (dance) can use her enchanting dance to distract her enemies. Whenever you start or maintain a beguiling dance, all enemies within 30 feet who can see you must succeed on a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. Creatures that fail this save also have their attitude improved by one step for as long as you maintain the dance (see Influencing NPC Attitudes, PH 74). This attitude adjustment does not prevent any subsequent attitude changes. For example, an enemy that becomes indifferent toward you as a result of this effect still turns hostile if you then attack it.
Wearying Dance: A 3rd-level cloaked dancer with 12 or more ranks in Perform (dance) can use her enchanting dance to tire her enemies. Whenever you start or maintain a wearying dance, all enemies within 30 feet who can see you must succeed on a Will save or be fatigued for as long as you maintain the dance. Creatures failing this save that are already fatigued become exhausted.

32
Frightful Dance: A 5th-level cloaked dancer with 14 or more ranks in Perform (dance) can use her enchanting dance to scare her enemies. Whenever you start or maintain a frightful dance, all enemies within 30 feet who can see you must succeed on a Will save or be shaken for as long as you maintain the dance. Creatures failing this save that are already shaken become frightened, and those that are already frightened become panicked.
#
Surprise Strike (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, you can make a particularly effective attack against creatures distracted by your dance. As a full-round action, you can maintain your enchanting dance and make a melee attack with a light weapon, dealing an extra 1d6 points of damage. At 4th level, the extra damage you deal increases to 2d6. The extra damage from the surprise strike ability stacks with the extra damage from sneak attack whenever both would apply to the same target. A target under the effect of your enchanting dance is considered flat-footed against the attack. Any creature that is not vulnerable to extra damage from sneak attacks is immune to this effect. This ability counts as sudden strike for the purpose of meeting prerequisites or using ambush feats (page 71).

###Block: Combat Trapsmith
34
Combat Trapping (Ex): You know how to create combat traps to aid your allies. At 1st level, you can learn two traps from the list in Table 2-6: Combat Traps, provided you meet the prerequisites. At each level thereafter, you add one additional trap to your repertoire, to a maximum of six traps known. Whenever you attain a new level in this class, you can choose to replace any one previously learned trap with a new trap. A combat trap is triggered by any Tiny or larger creature entering the trapped square. Flying or incorporeal creatures don't trigger combat traps. You can build a combat trap only on solid ground-you can't place it on a wall or ceiling, in the air, or floating in the water. A combat trap functions only once. Once set, it lasts for 1 hour or until triggered, whichever comes first. Crafting a combat trap requires a full-round action (which provokes attacks of opportunity) and a Craft (trapmaking) check. Each trap's entry lists the required Craft check DC. If the check is successful, you can place the trap in any square adjacent to your space. A failed check means that the action and materials are wasted to no effect, but you can try to set the same trap again later. Some combat traps allow a saving throw, as noted in a trap's entry. The save DC is 10 + your combat trapsmith level + your Int modifier. Locating or disabling a combat trap requires a successful Search or Disable Device check with a DC equal to 20 + your combat trapsmith level + your Int modifier. You can automatically find and disable your own combat traps. Because a combat trap is built quickly and crudely, it is also possible to discern with a successful Spot check (using the same DC as given above), whether or not the observer has the trapfinding class feature. All combat traps produce extraordinary effects, so dispel magic or spell resistance cannot interfere with them. Unless otherwise noted, an ongoing effect from a combat trap lasts for a number of rounds equal to your combat trapsmith level. Multiple effects from the same kind of combat trap don't stack; use only the longer duration. Creating combat traps requires a special kit containing raw materials and tools. A combat trapsmith's kit costs 100 gp, weighs 10 pounds, and provides components sufficient to create ten traps. A combat trap can't be cannibalized for raw materials, nor can its materials be retrieved if the trap isn't triggered.

35
Trap Sense (Ex): Beginning at 1st level, you become more adept at evading the effects of traps. See the barbarian class feature, PH 26. If you already have trap sense, this class feature provides no additional benefit.
Skill Focus: At 2nd level, you gain Skill Focus (Craft [trapmaking]) as a bonus feat. If you already have this feat, you can instead select any other feat for which you meet the prerequisite.
Improvised Materials (Ex): Beginning at 4th level, you can craft combat traps from raw materials at hand instead of relying on your combat trapsmith's kit. Doing so increases the Craft (trapmaking) check DC by 5 but otherwise has no effect on the trap's potency.
Expert Trapsetter (Ex): At 5th level, you can set a combat trap as a standard action without provoking attacks of opportunity.

##Block: Fortune's Friend
38
Spellcasting: At each even-numbered level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a fortune's friend, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Easy Luck (Ex): Luck comes to you naturally. The swift or immediate action to use a luck feat (page 72) does not count against your limit of one swift action per turn. However, you still can't expend a luck reroll more than once per turn to influence the same result.
Extra Fortune (Ex): At each odd-numbered level, you gain one extra luck reroll per day. This reroll is in addition to those granted by luck feats.
More Luck than Skill (Ex): Even if you have some talent in a particular area, you still depend on your luck to see you through. Once per day as a swift action, you can add your class level as a luck bonus on all skill checks you make until the start of your next turn.
Bonus Luck Feat: At 2nd and 4th level, you gain a bonus luck feat for which you meet the prerequisite. See page 75 for a complete list of luck feats.
Fortune's Favorite (Ex): By 3rd level, you have learned to rely on your luck to stay alive. Once per day as an immediate action, you can add your class level as a luck bonus on all saving throws you make until the start of your next turn.
Lucky Strike (Ex): Even the greatest warriors, those who train and drill constantly, occasionally win through sheer luck, so why shouldn't you? Beginning at 5th level, once per day as a swift action, you can add your class level as a luck bonus on all attack rolls you make until the start of your next turn.

###Block: Gray Guard
41
Spellcasting: At each even-numbered level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a gray guard, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Sacrament of Trust: Upon entering this prestige class, you take a vow of allegiance to your faith beyond that of any ordinary paladin. This vow grants you a measure of freedom to act on your cause's behalf without fear of retribution should your duties require you to break your code of conduct. Dishonorable acts still cause you to lose both gray guard and paladin class features until you atone, but this infraction is considered much less severe than it would be for a paladin. Thus, whenever you seek to atone for deeds that you willingly commit in the name of your faith but that break your code of conduct, a cleric casting an atonement spell on your behalf does not expend 500 XP as is normally required. This reprieve applies only to acts intended to further the cause of righteousness and the gray guard's faith. No XP cost applies to a gray guard atoning after beating a confession from a heretic, for example, but the cost would have to be paid for one who started a barroom brawl.
Lay on Hands (Su): This ability is identical to the paladin class feature of the same name (PH 44). Levels of gray guard stack with other class levels that grant lay on hands to determine the ability's total healing capacity.
Debilitating Touch (Su): At 2nd level, you learn to channel your lay on hands ability into a painful touch attack. Many gray guards use debilitating touch during interrogation, since it reduces the target's ability to successfully bluff or resist magical effects. Using debilitating touch does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An opponent hit by this attack is sickened for 5 rounds. Using this ability costs 5 points of your daily healing allotment. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + your gray guard level + your Cha modifier) negates the effect.
Smite Evil (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, you can smite evil once per day. See the paladin class feature (PH 44). At 8th level, you can smite evil one additional time per day. Levels of other classes that grant the smite evil class feature stack for the purpose of determining the extra damage dealt. For example, a 5th-level paladin/5th-level gray guard delivering a smite evil attack adds 10 points of damage to the attack.
Justice Blade (Su): By 4th level, you have learned that suffering and injustice are not the exclusive province of evil. You can use your smite evil ability to instead punish creatures of chaotic alignment. Using this ability expends one daily use of your smite evil class feature and works identically in all other ways, but its effect applies only to chaotic targets. Whenever you choose to smite an opponent, you must declare whether you are using this ability to smite evil or chaos. If you accidentally smite a creature of an alignment other than that declared, the smite has no effect but the ability is still used up. Beginning at 9th level, you can use justice blade to smite creatures of any alignment. You need not declare an alignment before making the smite attack, although if the attack misses, that use of smite is still used up for the day.

42
Devastating Touch (Su): When you attain 5th level, your deity shows its approval of your grim work. From this point on, you can use your lay on hands ability to make a touch attack that harms your enemies. Using devastating touch does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You decide how many points of your daily healing allotment to expend after successfully touching a creature: Each point expended deals 1 point of damage to the target. A nonevil creature is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + your gray guard level + your Cha modifier) to halve the amount of damage dealt.
Unbound Justice (Ex): At 7th level, unrestricted by your code of honor, you can employ unorthodox methods that are all the more effective because they're unexpected. You add half your gray guard level (round down) as a competence bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Intimidate skill checks.
Sacrament of the True Faith: At 10th level, you gain your order's full confidence. You are granted the freedom to act on behalf of your faith as you deem necessary. Thus, you never risk losing your class abilities in the pursuit of a just cause and never need to atone for violating your code of conduct. This trust does not grant you the freedom to act as violently or immorally as you wish, however. Release from your code of conduct depends on your acting as an exemplar of your order's ideals. If you violate this trust by habitually acting in an immoral or corrupt manner, the leaders or deity of your faith might revoke their blessing and banish you from the ranks of the faithful (see Ex-Gray Guards, below).
Code of Conduct: As a gray guard, you are held to the same code of conduct as a paladin. You must be of lawful good alignment and must never willingly commit an evil act. You must also pledge to respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, cheating, using poison, and the like), aid the needy, and punish those who harm the innocent. If you contravene your code of conduct, you must atone for the transgression or lose all class abilities from both gray guard and paladin levels. As you advance in the prestige class, this code becomes more flexible. However, its tenets still apply: You can never break your code without good reason. Gray guards can freely multiclass between paladin and gray guard.

###Block: Magical Trickster
45
Spellcasting: At each level after 1st, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a magical trickster, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Bonus Trick: At 1st level, and again at 3rd level, you gain a bonus skill trick for which you meet the prerequisite. These bonus tricks do not cost skill points and do not count against your maximum number of skill tricks available.
Spontaneous Trickster (Su): You can channel magical potential into using skill tricks more often, effectively "recharging" them. As a swift action, you can "lose" any spell slot or prepared spell of 1st level or higher to perform a trick that you have already used in the encounter.
Bonus Metamagic Feat: At 2nd level, you gain a bonus metamagic feat for which you meet the prerequisite.
Metamagic Trick (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, you understand how to apply the principle of tricks to your spellcasting. Once per day you can apply the effect of any one metamagic feat you know to a spell as you cast it without altering the spell's effective level. The spell slot adjustment of the metamagic feat can't exceed four.
Tricky Magic (Ex): At 3rd level, you have mastered incorporating tricks into your spellcasting routines. On any round that you perform a skill trick, the save DC of the next spell you cast that round is increased by 1.

###Block: Malconvoker
48
Spellcasting: At each level beyond 1st, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a malconvoker, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Deceptive Summons (Su): At 1st level, you can attempt to trick evil creatures you conjure into serving you for longer than they normally would. When casting a summon monster spell to summon an evil-aligned creature, you can attempt a Bluff check as a free action, opposed by the creature's Sense Motive check. If your check succeeds, the duration of the effect is doubled (as if by the Extend Spell feat), and the summoned creature might be subject to additional effects as described below. If it fails, the duration remains as normal and no additional effects can be applied. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the creature breaks free of your control and is hostile toward you (though it still disappears as normal when the spell's duration ends). If you use this ability when summoning multiple creatures, you must attempt an opposed skill check separately against each creature you wish to affect. Beginning at 4th level, you can whip the deceived creatures into an infernal fury. If your Bluff check to extend the duration of summoning succeeds, the creatures get a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls and 2 extra hit points per Hit Die (in addition to the bonuses conferred by Augment Summoning). Beginning at 7th level, you can instill the deceived creatures with exceptional resistance to your enemies' attempts to control or dismiss them. If your Bluff check to extend the duration of summoning succeeds, the creatures get a +2 bonus on Will saves, and your effective caster level is increased by 2 for the purpose of resisting dispel magic and similar effects against those creatures.
Unrestricted Conjuration: For the purpose only of casting conjuration spells, you can ignore any restrictions that forbid you from casting spells of certain alignments. In addition, regular use of conjuration spells with the evil descriptor does not threaten to change your alignment. For example, a good cleric who becomes a malconvoker could cast summon monster I to summon a fiendish raven (whose alignment gives the spell the evil descriptor). The cleric could not cast death knell, though, which has the evil descriptor but is not of the conjuration school.

49
Planar Binding: Beginning at 2nd level, you can add the following spells to your class spell list and your list of known spells (or your spellbook) at the indicated levels. If you already have one or more of these spells on your class list at a different level, treat it as being of the lower level. 5th: lesser planar binding. 6th: planar binding. 8th: greater planar binding.
Skill Focus (Bluff): At 3rd level, you gain Skill Focus (Bluff) as a bonus feat. If you already have this feat, you can select any other feat for which you meet the prerequisite.
Fiendish Legion (Ex): Once you attain 5th level, whenever you use a summon monster spell to summon one or more evil-aligned creatures, you summon one extra creature of the same kind.
Deceitful Bargaining (Ex): Starting at 6th level, you become exceptionally adept at convincing evil creatures you call that your intentions parallel their own. Upon calling an evil outsider using a planar binding spell, you can make a Bluff check opposed by the creature's Sense Motive skill check. If you succeed on this check, the called creature becomes more amenable to your cause, taking a -5 penalty on the opposed Charisma check made to refuse serving you. If you fail, the creature immediately makes a new Will saving throw against your spell. On a failure, the spell functions as normal. If it succeeds on this save, the creature breaks free of your control and can either flee or attack you.
Improved Calling (Su): At 8th level, your understanding of the ways of fiends shows you how to tempt even more powerful beings into your service. The normal HD limit for your planar ally and planar binding spells (including lesser and greater versions) increases by 2.
Safe Summoning (Ex): At 9th level, you can dismiss any evil creature that you have summoned as an immediate action rather than as a standard action.

###Block: Master of Masks
52
Spellcasting: At 2nd, 4th, 7th, and 9th level, you gain
new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells
known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a
spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the
prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other
benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you
had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a
master of masks, you must decide to which class to add
each level for the purpose of determining spells per day,
caster level, and spells known.
Persona Masks (Su): You gain the ability to craft potent
magical masks, each of which allows you to take on a different
persona and gain some aspect of that creature or
archetypal character. At 1st level, you learn to create and
use two masks selected from those described below. At 2nd
level, and at every odd-numbered level thereafter, you can
create and use one more mask from the list.
Creating a new persona mask requires 8 hours of work
and costs 100 gp. You can use only persona masks that
you have crafted. No one else (not even another master
of masks) can benefit from a persona mask that you
create.
To gain the benefit of a mask, you merely wear it. Putting
on a mask is a standard action, and removing one is a move
action. Once it is worn, the mask's benefit immediately
applies. Your master of masks level is your caster level for
any spell-like abilities produced by a mask.
In addition to its other benefits, a mask conceals your
alignment, replacing it (for the purpose of detection spells
or abilities) with an alignment appropriate to the mask. You
still retain your normal alignment for all other purposes
(such as if a paladin uses smite evil against you).
One or more persona masks can be worn at the same
time, occupying the eye lenses/goggles body slot.
Angel: The image of an androgynous face with eyes
serenely upturned to the heavens forms this mask, carved
from flawless alabaster. Cultic runes adorn the forehead
and cheeks, and its edges are ringed by downy feathers.
As an immediate action, you can use feather fall as a
spell-like ability any number of times per day, but only on
yourself.

53

Once per day as a swift action, you can use fly as a spelllike
ability; the effect lasts for 5 rounds. As you advance
in the master of masks class, you can use this ability more
often: twice per day at 4th level, three times per day at 7th
level, and four times per day at 10th level.
Your alignment appears to be lawful good while you wear
an angel mask.
Archmage: This mask of deep purple fluorite is sculpted
in the image of a heavily wrinkled old man. A roughly
circular tangle of arcane runes appears where the visage's
mouth should be.
You can use each of these spell-like abilities once per day:
charm person, dancing lights, detect magic, and magic missile.
As you advance in the master of masks class, you can use
additional spell-like abilities, each once per day: 4th level,
invisibility and scorching ray; 7th level, lightning bolt and slow;
and 10th level, dimension door and ice storm.
Your caster level is treated as two higher for the purpose
of casting arcane spells (up to a maximum of your character
level). If you have no arcane spellcasting ability, this effect
grants you no benefit.
Your alignment appears to be chaotic good while you
wear an archmage mask.
Assassin: Hardened black leather and metal clasps create
the disturbing aspect of the assassin. A jagged, cruel slit
forms the opening for the mouth, and the mask's edges
are worn and stained.
You can deliver a sneak attack that deals an extra 1d6
points of damage when you are flanking an opponent or
at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity
bonus (see the rogue class feature, PH 50). As you advance in
the master of masks class, your sneak attack becomes more
devastating: This extra damage improves to 2d6 points at
4th level, 3d6 at 7th level, and 4d6 at 10th level. If you get
a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue
levels), the bonuses on damage stack.
In addition, you gain a +2 competence bonus on Hide
and Move Silently checks. This bonus improves to +4 at
4th level, +6 at 7th level, and +8 at 10th level.
Your alignment appears to be lawful evil while you wear
an assassin mask.
Demon: This obsidian mask bears the visage of a darkly
handsome fiend. Small, black horns adorn the demon's
forehead, and its black ears rise to points. Its smiling mouth
shows rows of sharp teeth.
Once per day, you can use summon monster III as a
spell-like ability, only to summon creatures of chaotic evil
alignment. As you advance in the master of masks class,
you can summon increasingly powerful creatures: At 4th
level, you can instead use summon monster IV; at 7th level,
summon monster V; and at 10th level, summon monster VI.
Your alignment appears to be chaotic evil while you wear
a demon mask.
Dragon: This multihued mask of precious metals and scintillating
gemstones forms the terrible visage of a snarling
wyrm. A sunburst of metallic and bejeweled scales flares
out around the reptilian face.
Three times per day you can breathe a cone of fire as
a standard action. The cone is 30 feet long and deals 2d8
points of fire damage. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 +
your master of masks level + your Cha modifier) halves
the damage dealt. Once you use this ability, you can't use
it again for 1d4 rounds. As you advance in the class, you
can deal additional damage with this ability: 4d8 points at
4th level, 6d8 at 7th level, and 10d8 at 10th level.
Your alignment appears to be neutral evil while you wear
a dragon mask.
Faceless: Only a pair of empty eyeholes break this otherwise
featureless oval, porcelain mask.
You gain a +5 competence bonus on saves against mindaffecting
spells and abilities. You are protected from
divination effects as if by a nondetection spell; the DC of
the caster level check is 15 + your master of masks level.
Even if the nondetection effect is overcome, your alignment
appears to be neutral while you wear a faceless
mask.
Gladiator: This wyvern-hide mask is shaped like the
face of a grim warrior. Scars cover its surface, and silver
chainmail rings surround its outer edge.
You gain proficiency with all martial and exotic weapons.
You also gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and
weapon damage rolls. As you advance in the master of

54

masks class, you become more expert in weapon use: This
bonus improves to +2 at 4th level, +3 at 7th level, and +4 at
10th level.
Your alignment appears to be neutral while you wear a
gladiator mask.
High Priest: This mask of rose porphyry has a wide mouth
open in song, but instead of eyes it has slits twisted into
runes (these do not restrict your vision).
You can use each of the following spell-like abilities
once per day: bless, cure light wounds, protection from evil, and
sanctuary. As you advance in the class, you can use additional
spell-like abilities, each once per day: At 4th level, you can
use aid and lesser restoration; at 7th level, cure serious wounds
and remove curse; and at 10th level, death ward and neutralize
poison.
Your caster level is treated as two higher for the purpose
of casting divine spells (up to a maximum of your character
level). If you have no divine spellcasting ability, this effect
grants you no benefit.
Your alignment appears to be neutral good while you
wear a high priest mask.
Jester: Gaudy ribbons, tinkling bells, and a bobbing cockscomb
adorn this leather mask. Brightly hued eyeshadow,
lipstick, and alternating red, black, and white diamonds
flamboyantly paint the form's angular features.
You gain a +2 competence bonus on Balance, Perform,
Sleight of Hand, and Tumble checks. As you advance in the
master of masks class, you become more proficient with
these skills: This bonus improves to +4 at 4th level, +6 at
7th level, and +8 at 10th level.
Your alignment appears to be chaotic neutral while you
wear a jester mask.
Lich: This mask is made of poorly cured, purplish skin
stretched over yellowed bone. Bloodless cuts and old bruises
mar its surface, and tufts of long, white hair sprout from
its wrinkled brow.
Once per day you can use cause fear and detect undead as
spell-like abilities. As you advance in the master of masks
class, you can use additional spell-like abilities, each once
per day: At 4th level, you can use false life; at 7th level, halt
undead; and at 10th level, fear.
Additionally, you gain resistance to cold 10.
Your alignment appears to be neutral evil while you
wear a lich mask. Furthermore, you register as an undead
creature with Hit Dice equal to your character level to any
form of magical divination (such as detect undead).
Lord: A swirling mixture of gleaming copper and silver
forms the regal countenance of a smiling man. A gem-studded
diadem adorns its brow, and stamped across its surface
are layered images of coins.
Once per day, you can use remove fear as a spell-like ability.
As you advance in the master of masks class, you can
use additional spell-like abilities, each once per day: At 4th
level, you can use eagle's splendor; at 7th level, heroism; and
at 10th level, dispel chaos.
In addition, you gain a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy
and Gather Information checks. This bonus improves
to +4 at 4th level, +6 at 7th level, and +8 at 10th level.
Your alignment appears to be lawful neutral while you
wear a lord mask.
Savage: Bright, flaking warpaint streaks this battered
wooden image of a snarling, fang-toothed wild man.
Your hands transform into claws, granting you two
primary natural weapon attacks, each dealing 1d4 points
of damage (assuming you are Medium), plus your Strength
modifier. You are considered to be proficient with your
natural weapons. Your claws overcome damage reduction
as if they were magic weapons.
As you advance in the master of masks class, you can deal
more damage with your claws: 1d6 points at 4th level, 1d8
at 7th level, and 2d6 at 10th level.
Your alignment appears to be chaotic neutral while you
wear a savage mask.
Mask Specialist (Su): Starting at 3rd level, you innately
enhance the abilities of any magic mask you wear (such as
the mask of the skull, DMG 262). If the mask creates an effect
that requires a saving throw, the save DC increases by 2.
If the mask grants a bonus on skill checks, that bonus is
increased by 2. Otherwise, the mask's caster level is treated
as two higher.
This ability has no effect on the persona masks you create
and use.
Many Faces (Ex): At 5th level, you can wear more than
one persona mask simultaneously. You can use the abilities
of only one mask at a time, but you can switch between
masks more quickly.
While wearing a persona mask, you can don a second
without taking off the first. The appearance and benefit of
the second replace those of the first. As a move action, you
can have the first mask appear instead, granting its effect
in place of the other's.
At 8th level, you can wear up to three masks simultaneously
and can switch masks as a swift action.
At 10th level, you can wear up to four masks simultaneously
and can switch masks as an immediate action.
While wearing multiple persona masks in this way, you
can remove any worn mask as a move action (regardless of
which one is active).
Hidden Mask (Su): Beginning at 6th level, you can
make any mask you wear become invisible (or return an
invisible mask to visibility). Activating or deactivating this
ability requires a swift action. The mask's benefit applies
regardless of whether it is visible.

###Block: Mountebank
57
Tongue of the Devil (Ex): Your cunning misdirection
leaves others at your mercy. You add your Intelligence bonus
(if any) to Bluff checks.
Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, you deal
an extra 1d6 points of damage when you are flanking an
opponent or at any time when the target would be denied
its Dexterity bonus. See the rogue class feature, PH 50.
The extra damage dealt by your sneak attack increases to
2d6 at 5th level and to 3d6 at 8th level. If you get a sneak
attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels),
the bonuses on damage stack.
Alter Ego (Sp): Starting at 3rd level, you establish an
alternate identity. This alter ego has its own distinct physical
characteristics, quirks, preferred clothing, and so on.
At will, you can switch your form between that of your
normal identity and that of your alter ego. This ability works
like the alter self spell, except that you can assume only the

58
appearance of your alternate identity. Your caster level for
this ability is equal to your mountebank class level.
As you advance in this prestige class, you develop additional
alter egos, gaining a new one every three levels beyond
1st (two at 6th and three at 9th).
Sideslip (Su): Beginning at 4th level, you become
supernaturally elusive. Once per day as an immediate
action, you can transfer yourself from your current space
to another up to 20 feet away. This ability otherwise works
like the dimension door spell, except that you cannot
transport other creatures with you. At 6th level, and at
every two levels thereafter, you gain an additional daily
use of sideslip.
Slippery Mind (Ex): Starting at 7th level, whenever you
are affected by an enchantment spell or effect and you fail
your saving throw, you can attempt it again 1 round later
at the same DC. You get only one extra chance to succeed
on your save using this ability.
Sudden Escape (Sp): Beginning at 10th level, you can
expend two daily uses of your sideslip ability as a swift
action to use dimension door, as the spell. Your caster level
is equal to your character level.

###Block: Psibond Agent
60
Psibond (Su): As a member of this class, you know how
to create a mental link between yourself and a subject.
You must be psionically focused to forge the psibond, but
afterward you can expend your focus as needed to use
other abilities. Establishing a psibond requires a standard
action, and an unwilling subject is allowed a Will save
(DC 10 + your psibond agent level + your Cha modifier)
to resist. Once established, a psibond lasts as long as you
concentrate, up to a maximum of 1 minute per class level.
The maximum range at which a psibond can be established

61
is 100 feet, but once in place it persists even if the subject
moves out of this range (the psibond is suppressed, but not
broken, while the subject is on a different plane). A psibond
grants you various options for gathering information or
controlling the subject, based on your class level.
Forced Sense Link: At 1st level, you can use a swift action to
perceive what the subject perceives using its sight, hearing,
taste, or smell. This sense link lasts until you take another
swift action to end it, or until the psibond's duration ends.
Only one sense is linked, and you cannot switch between
senses with the same psibond. You make any skill checks
involving senses, such as Spot or Listen, as if you were the
subject (using that individual's skill modifiers), and as if
you were in the subject's location. You lose your Dexterity
bonus to AC while directly sensing what the subject senses.
This ability otherwise works like the forced sense link power
(Expanded Psionics Handbook 131).
Nudge: Beginning at 2nd level, you can subtly influence
the subject of your psibond. As an immediate action, you
can implant a subtle suggestion about which course of
action the subject takes if presented with a choice. You
cannot communicate any specific action to your subject;
you can only nudge it toward a specific choice. For example,
if your subject is offered a choice of shifts for the night
watch, you can suggest which one to take. No saving throw
applies against this effect, but if the suggested action presents
any obvious danger to the subject, your nudge fails; the
psibond isn't broken. You can't implant the same nonverbal
suggestion more than once during the same psibond.
Empathy: At 4th level, you can detect the surface emotions
of the subject of your psibond as a free action. You also gain
a +2 insight bonus on any Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or
Sense Motive check made against that subject as long as
the psibond is in place.
Suggestion: Beginning at 6th level, you can use a swift
action to use suggestion (as the spell) on the subject of your
psibond. The subject is allowed a Will save (DC 13 + your
Cha modifier) to resist the effect. You can't use this ability
more than once during the same psibond.
False Sensory Input: At 8th level, you gain a limited ability
to falsify one of the senses of your psibond's subject.
This requires a swift action to activate or maintain each
round, and otherwise works like the false sensory input
power (Expanded Psionics Handbook 106), though no save is
allowed.
Dominate: At 10th level, you gain the ability to fully
control the subject of your psibond. This works like the
dominate monster spell (PH 224) and requires a standard
action to activate. The subject is allowed a Will save (DC 19
+ your Cha modifier) to resist the effect. If you successfully
dominate the subject, the effect lasts for 1 hour. Using this
ability automatically ends your psibond with the subject,
regardless of whether it succeeds on the save.
Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, you deal an
extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or
any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus.
See the rogue class feature, PH 50. The extra damage dealt

62
increases to 2d6 at 6th level and to 3d6 at 9th level. If you
get a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue
levels), the bonuses on damage stack.
Lingering Psibond (Su): When you attain 5th level,
your psibond becomes more powerful. Your psibond
remains in place for 1 round after you cease concentrating.
If you resume concentration in the next round, you
retain the psibond's effect as if you had never stopped
concentrating.
Double Psibond (Su): At 7th level, you learn the secret
of maintaining two psibonds simultaneously. Each psibond
must be established separately against a different subject,
but your concentration maintains both links equally well.
Using any special abilities through the links must be done
separately (for example, establishing a forced sense link
requires a separate swift action for each subject).


###Block: Spellwarp Sniper
64
Spellcasting: At each level, you gain new spells per
day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if
applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting
class to which you belonged before adding the prestige
class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a
character of that class would have gained. If you had more
than one spellcasting class before becoming a spellwarp
sniper, you must decide to which class to add each level for
the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and
spells known.
Spellwarp (Ex): You can alter the form of certain area
spells into rays as you cast them. As a free action, you can
warp a 1st-level area spell with instantaneous duration and
a range greater than touch. The spell's level, components,
range, and damage (if any) remain unchanged. However, the
spell's area entry is replaced by an effect entry of "ray."
The spell acts in all ways as a ray, and is considered a ray
for the purpose of effects that modify or depend on rays
(such as the other abilities of this prestige class). You must
succeed on a ranged touch attack to affect an opponent with
the spell. Even if the original spell allowed a Reflex save to
reduce or negate its effect, the ray does not. However, if the
original spell allowed a Fortitude or Will save to reduce or
negate the spell's effect, the save still applies.
You must decide to warp the spell as you cast it. You
do not need to prepare it as a warped spell. You can apply
metamagic feats as normal to the spell, as long as they can
affect ray spells.
Each time you advance a level in this class, the maximum
level of spell that you can affect increases by one. For
example, a 3rd-level spellwarp sniper can warp spells of
up to 3rd level.
Sudden Raystrike (Ex): If you can catch an opponent
when he is unable to defend himself effectively from your
ray attack, you can strike a vital spot for extra damage.
Whenever the target of one of your ray spells is denied a
Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a
Dexterity bonus of not), you deal an extra 1d6 points of
damage with your ray spell. (If your ray spell doesn't deal
hit point damage, this extra damage doesn't apply.) At 4th
level, the extra damage increases to 2d6. If you get a sneak
attack or sudden strike bonus from another source (such
as rogue or ninja levels), the bonuses on damage stack
whenever both abilities would apply to the same target.
This damage applies only to targets within 30 feet.
Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible
anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from
critical hits are all immune to your sudden raystrikes.
Precise Shot: At 3rd level, you gain Precise Shot as a
bonus feat. If you already have Precise Shot, you can select
any other feat that has Point Blank Shot as a prerequisite,
as long as you meet the prerequisite for the chosen feat.

65
Ray Mastery (Ex): At 5th level, you attain unequaled
control over your ray spells. This control manifests in three
ways.
. You can apply the extra damage from the sudden raystrike
ability (as well as any additional sneak attack or sudden
strike damage from other sources) to ray attacks against a
target within 60 feet, instead of 30 feet.
. You can deliver a coup de grace with a ray spell that deals
hit point damage. You must be adjacent to your target to
deliver the coup de grace.
. Once per day, you can empower a single ray spell,
as though with the Empower Spell feat, without
any adjustment to the spell's level
or casting time. This effect applies
equally to spells that are
already rays and those
you warp into
rays.

###Block: Uncanny Trickster
67
Class Features: At each level after 1st, you gain class
features (including spellcasting ability) and an increase in
effective level as if you had also gained a level in a class to
which you belonged before adding the prestige class level.
You do not, however, gain the benefit of your previous
class's Hit Dice, attack progression, skill points, or saving
throws. If you had more than one class before becoming an
uncanny trickster, you must decide to which class to add
each level for the purpose of determining class features.
Bonus Trick (Ex): At each level, you gain a bonus skill
trick for which you meet the prerequisite. These bonus
tricks do not cost skill points and do not count against
your maximum number of skill tricks available.
Favorite Trick (Ex): You have a limited repertoire of
signature stunts. At each level, choose one skill trick you
know that you can perform only once per encounter. You
can now use that trick one additional time per encounter.
You can't choose the same skill trick more than once.
Tricky Defense (Ex): At 3rd level, you have mastered
incorporating tricks into your personal defenses. In any
round when you perform a skill trick, you gain a +1 competence
bonus on saving throws until the start of your
next turn.
