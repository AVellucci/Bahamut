Awe											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VampireDiscipline.Majesty																																		DEFINE:AweDC|10+TL+CHA		DESC:You amplify your personality to more easily influence other people. You gain a +5 bonus on social skills (such as most uses of Diplomacy and Gather Information) made to influence or deter others. This Discipline affects everyone who can see you. It does not work through photos, video or other artificial visual means. Even after the effect ends, targets remember their enhanced feelings toward you and are inclined to tailor their future reactions accordingly. (You don't get additional bonuses, but someone who liked you previously doesn't turn against you when you're not around.) Local disturbances and concerns of safety end the effect for nearby targets. (They may be listening with rapt attention but someone drawing a gun on them has a higher priority.) Targets get a Will save to resist this ability (DC %1). When dealing with large numbers of normal humans, make one skill roll with a penalty (-4 for 10, -8 for 20, -12 for 50, -16 for 100 or more) rather than individual rolls.

SOURCEPAGE:p.144
Command										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VampireDiscipline.Dominate																																							DESC:You make eye contact with a person and issue a one-word command that he must obey instantly unless he makes a Will save. The command must be clear and straightforward - freeze, jump, run, stop, fall, blink and so on. If the command is ambiguous or confusing, the target may respond slowly or perform the task poorly. The target always interprets the command in his own best interest. For example, if you command a man on a rooftop ledge to 'jump' he jumps in place or onto the roof rather than to his death. 'Sleep' or other commands that leave the target helpless are effective only if the target believes he is not in any mortal danger, and work for only one round. If the command is something that can be carried out for some time (such as wait, eat or guard), the target complies for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum one round). You may use the command in a sentence so as to disguise the use of this ability, though you must still stress that word so the target knows which command to obey, and those familiar with this Discipline may recognize this tactic. Commands must be verbal, though in some cases a gesture and eye movement may be sufficient (such as 'come'). A target may announce on his turn that he is avoiding your gaze; doing so means for the next round he has a 50%% chance of not needing to make a save against this Discipline, but you have 20%% concealment against him (because he cannot focus his entire attention on you). - Ventrue [The target takes a -4 penalty to resist your command] - Standard Action - Cost 0 Vitae - Duration Until you end it																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.144

Heightened Senses									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:VampireDiscipline.Auspex																																								DESC:You magnify your senses to a superhuman level, giving you a +5 bonus on Listen, Search and Spot checks. At the GM's discretion you may get this bonus on other skill checks as well (Sense Motive checks, for example). When your sight is heightened, you have darkvision (60 feet) and your low-light vision range is doubled, so you see four times as far as a normal human in low light conditions. While your senses are heightened, you are vulnerable to attacks on those senses, taking a -4 penalty on saves to resist such attacks and suffering whatever additional effect the attack has against vulnerable creatures. You may selectively amplify only some of your senses (instead of all of them at once) to reduce the number of possible sources. Adjusting which senses are magnified is a free action.
