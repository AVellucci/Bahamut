###Demon Description
# Ability Name								Description of the Benefits
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Battle Claws.MOD				BENEFIT:You grow strong claws on your hands (and feet, if you so choose). These claws are natural weapons that each deal 1d8 points of slashing damage. When the claws are out, you gain a +8 equipment bonus on Climb checks. You can retract or extend the claws as a free action. If you are in your true form and it does not have hands, an appropriate part of your body grows claws or spines or some other natural weapon you can use; if your true form doesn't have limbs, you temporarily grow simple limbs or pseudopods ending in sharp blades for this purpose. The claws look strange and unearthly, unlike any normal animal. Scourge: When you score a critical hit with a claw, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) or be dazed for one round because of the pain of your attack. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Anima - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Breach Barrier.MOD			BENEFIT:You alter your molecular structure to pass through solid objects. You can penetrate wood, plaster or stone to a depth of five feet but cannot enter metal unless you spend an additional one Anima. You can pass through thicker materials by spending one Anima per five feet of distance (plus one additional Anima if metal blocks that distance). You cannot pass through supernatural barriers or force fields (if such things exist). While in this ghostly state, you are invulnerable to physical attacks (including nonmagical energy) and unable to affect anything (even yourself) physically or supernaturally. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Anima or more - Duration=1 round
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Breach Space.MOD				BENEFIT:You travel instantly to another location. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. If you are not very familiar with the location (it is not a place you have been often), you must make a Will save to successfully teleport. Your level of familiarity determines the save DC, as shown in the following chart. DC Familiarity 20 Studied carefully: A place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often or you have used other means (such as scrying, a surveillance feed or the eyes of a thrall) to study the place for at least one hour. 25 Seen casually: A place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not familiar, or the current location of a thrall. 30 Viewed once: A place that you have seen once, possibly using means other than visiting it directly. If you fail the save, you fail to teleport. If you roll a 1 on the save, you appear (safely) a random distance away from the destination in a random direction (both determined by the GM  distance off target is 1d10 x d%% of the distance that you were to travel). - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Anima - Duration=1 round
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Confess.MOD				BENEFIT:This cant functions as the vampire Discipline Revelation (see below). The target takes a 5 penalty on his save if he is currently subject to your Insinuate or Torturous Memory cant. Tempter: The target has a 4 penalty to resist this cant. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Anima - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Conjure Demonic Minion.MOD		BENEFIT:You conjure a minor minion with the demonic template (see Chapter 8: Running the Game, "Antagonists and Supporting Characters," Minions). Special: You can select this feat up to four times. Its effects do not stack. Every time beyond the first you select this feat, the type of demon minion you can conjure is improved by one step (to lesser, greater and superior). You cannot conjure a minion with more Hit Dice than you. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Anima per rank of the minion (1 for minor, 2 for lesser, 3 for greater, 4 for superior) - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Corrupting Lash.MOD			BENEFIT:Make a melee touch attack. If you hit, for every Anima you spend on the attack, you deal 2d6 points of demonic energy damage to the target (Fortitude half, DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier). You must decide how much Anima to spend before you make the attack roll. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Anima or more - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Corrupting Matrix.MOD			BENEFIT:You amplify your matrix so you leak harmful energy. Any creature within five feet of you takes 1d6 points of demonic energy damage every round on your turn. If a creature within five feet harms you, feedback from your matrix deals 1d6 points of demonic energy damage to it, though this result can be no more than the damage you took from the attack. For example, if a human stabs you for three points of damage, the feedback can deal only up to three points of damage to the human; if you roll a 4, 5 or 6 on the feedback damage die, treat the result as a 3. Scourge: Your aura deals 2d6 points of damage instead of 1d6. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Anima - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Demonic Will.MOD				BENEFIT:Your maximum Anima increases by 10 and the number of Anima you can spend per round increases by one. The maximum amount of time you can spend in an alternate form before needing to return to your true form decreases by five minutes. Special: You may take this cant up to five times. Its effects (positive and negative) stack.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Extend Disguise.MOD			BENEFIT:You may stay in an alternate form for an additional 10 minutes before reverting to your true form. You can use this ability multiple times to further extend your time in another form. If you switch to a different form (even another alternate form), you lose the benefits of this cant. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Anima - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Flesh Transparency.MOD			BENEFIT:You allow your true form to show through your mortal disguise for just a moment. Any creature that sees you clearly must make a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened and flee for 2d6 rounds. A creature that rolls a 1 on its save is panicked rather than frightened. (See Chapter 7: Playing the Game, "Special Abilities," Fear.) The viewers must have line of sight to you; seeing you in a mirror, photo or television is no more frightening than any other special effect. This transformation does not affect your remaining time transformed or the recovery period after shapechanging. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Anima - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Flight.MOD					BENEFIT:You can fly at a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability). You can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed. Flying requires only as much concentration as walking, so you can take actions normally. You can charge while flying, but you cannot run and cannot carry aloft more weight than your maximum load. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Anima - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Great Stature.MOD			BENEFIT:You grow larger, increasing in size by one size category. When you grow, adjust your abilities scores follows: Strength +4, Dexterity 2, Constitution +4. Your natural bonus to Defense (if any) increases by +2 but you take a 1 size penalty to Defense and attack rolls. Your space becomes 10 feet, and your reach increases to 10 feet. The damage dice of your natural attacks (if any) increase by one step (see the Improved Natural Attack feat for the progression). These changes go away when you return to your normal size (a free action). Objects in your possession do not change size. You cannot use this cant while it is already active (i.e., you cannot increase your size by more than one category). You may also increase your size without changing your size category; this does not affect your abilities but does make you taller. Scourge: Your Strength increases by +8 rather than +4. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Anima - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Husk Minion.MOD				BENEFIT:You conjure a minor minion with the zombie template (see Chapter 8: Running the Game, "Antagonists and Supporting Characters," Minions), using a dead human body as the substrate. If the body is one of your thralls or someone you killed with Corrupting Lash or Corrupting Matrix, the duration is 10 minutes. Special: You can select this feat up to four times. Its effects do not stack. Every time beyond the first you select this feat, the type of zombie minion you can conjure is improved by one step (to lesser, greater and superior). You cannot conjure a minion with more Hit Dice than you. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Anima per rank of the minion (1 for minor, 2 for lesser, 3 for grater, 4 for superior) - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Imbue Object.MOD				BENEFIT:You can imbue an object with energy so that any creature wearing or carrying it gains a supernatural power. You can give an object any one of the following powers: +4 to one ability score, +10 on checks with one skill, +10 hit points or darkvision. The item functions ge 4 flying conjure demonic minion  imbue object automatically when touched  the bearer does not need to activate it. Your alien energy weakens the object, reducing its hardness and hit points by 1. - Action=Standard - Cost=5 Anima - Duration=1 day
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Infernal Pact.MOD			BENEFIT:As a being born of energy, you understand exchanges of power. By giving a mortal something he wants (money, superhuman strength, an enemy's death and so on), he must balance the equation by giving you something you want (typically Anima, though you may desire a service instead). Unfortunately for mortals, pacts with demons don't work like in the movies. Demons are not omnipotent, so you have limits as to what you can give a mortal  if you aren't wealthy, you can't give a mortal a million dollars, if you don't control a small country you can't make him a king, and so on. Part of the trick to making a pact is finding a mortal who wants something within your power to grant: sex, comfort, knowledge, vengeance and so on. Not including any roleplaying or monetary resources at your disposal, you can create any one of the following supernatural gifts for a mortal as part of a pact: +4 to one ability score, +10 on checks with one skill, +10 hit points, darkvision, temporarily cure a disease or suspend a physical drawback (such as making a crippled leg fully functional). Though these gifts aren't on par with granting wishes, a feeble old man can feel better with an improved Constitution, a paralyzed football player can walk if you suspend his broken back, a gambler can be lucky with a Profession skill bonus and so on. A clever demon can promise almost anything within the scope of these powers  a man who wants to seduce a coworker needs a Charisma boost, a researcher who wants to make a scientific breakthrough needs a Knowledge (earth and life sciences) boost and so on. In most cases, what you want from a mortal is Anima, though he sees it in terms of his "soul." From your point of view, your pact creates a trickle of energy from him to you, giving you one Anima every day as long as he is alive and one additional Anima if he dies while the pact is in effect. From his point of view, he owes you his soul, which you will claim when he dies. Unlike a pact with a mythical demon, you both want him to hold off dying as long as possible  you because you don't want the influx of Anima to end, he because he doesn't want to be dead and especially doesn't want to give up his soul. It is a win-win situation  especially, because if you get bored with the agreement, you can just kill him. Altering the mortal to grant his gift requires momentary physical contact, though some demons enjoy theatrics such as swearing in blood, signing contracts and so on. The mortal must be a willing participant and able to make decisions for himself  any resistance or supernatural interference (such as mind control) prevents the pact from taking effect. The act of altering the mortal also establishes the Anima link, if that is your payment. Every day afterward, you automatically drain one Anima from him (typically at sundown). A mortal in a pact with a demon is called a thrall. Accepting a demonic pact automatically reduces a mortal's Wisdom by two points; interfacing with your matrix is traumatic and fundamentally damaging to mortals despite any gifts you grant them. This reduction is permanent; neither magic, rest nor any other force can repair it. You can end a pact as a standard action (the mortal doesn't need to be present), which immediately causes the mortal to lose his pact-granted gift and severs the link that provides you Anima. You or another demon can forge another pact with the mortal (though by all rights he should be suspicious of such a contract, having had it unilaterally broken once before). The only way a mortal can end a pact unilaterally is to die, though he can have you end it for him. (Most demons require a suitable mortal replacement before they agree to do this.) A mortal can have only one pact at a time. (Trying to forge a second one automatically fails.) You can maintain one pact per point of your Charisma bonus. An unbroken pact counts as an acquaintance-level sympathetic connection between the mortal and you (see Chapter 5: Magic, "Spells," Spell Range.) You cannot forge a pact with an animal or another demon, but you can form them with humans, Awakened, mages, vampires and werewolves. You can forge a pact on behalf of another demon (building a link between it and the mortal), but doing so costs 10 Anima instead of the normal five. The other demon normally provides the Anima to create the pact and some additional payment (Anima, a service, information and so on). Once you create the pact, you are no longer involved and the other demon is considered the pact's creator. - Action=Standard - Cost=5 Anima - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Insinuate.MOD				BENEFIT:You improve the target's attitude toward you by one category (see the Diplomacy skill in Chapter 3). You must talk to your target, and he must be able to hear you speak. You cannot improve someone's attitude above friendly with this cant. The target gets a Will save to resist (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). This cant does not affect anyone in combat, expecting combat or in fear of serious or mortal harm. You can use this cant on a particular creature no more than once per minute (success or failure). Tempter: You can use this cant when the target is in combat, expecting combat or in fear of harm. - Action=Standard - Cost=0 Anima - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Manipulate Attraction.MOD		BENEFIT:[Free Action, Anima Cost 0, Lasts until you end it] You increase or decrease the affinity your body's molecules have toward other things, which increases or decreases how "sticky" you are. Increasing your affinity gives you a +10 bonus on Climb checks, checks to resist being disarmed, grapple checks (on any grappling action except trying to escape a grapple) and similar checks when having a strong grip is an advantage. You can even climb a perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surface (Climb DC 30) or stick things to your body to leave your hands free. Decreasing your affinity gives you a +10 bonus on Escape Artist checks, Swim checks, grapple checks to escape a grapple and similar checks when being more slippery is an advantage. This slipperiness means debris such as dirt and sand is less likely to stick to you; even minute particles such as gunpowder residue and blood spatters tend to slide off. Use of this ability does not change your appearance or texture, and does not cover you in any kind of film or residue; this is an instant alteration in local physics. Ending the ability is a free action. You may increase or decrease your affinity as often as you like on your turn; for example, you can reduce your affinity to escape a grapple, increase it to climb a wall to safety, then reduce it again to slide down a garbage chute. This cant affects your entire body - you cannot make part of yourself sticky and another part slippery.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Manipulate Cohesion.MOD		BENEFIT:You increase or decrease a touched object's hardness by 8. This cant cannot reduce an item's hardness to less than 0; if it would do so, the object instead reduces its hardness to 0 and deals 1d6 points of demonic energy damage for each remaining point of hardness reduction. For example, a piece of wood with hardness 5 becomes hardness 0 and takes (8  5 =) 3d6 points of demonic energy damage. You can use this cant on a liquid, temporarily hardening it enough to support a human's weight. This application converts one five-foot square per your Hit Die. You can alter air this way, though the cant affects only one-fourth of the area. You may use this cant once per round. An attended object gets a save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). Scourge: Decreasing an object's hardness costs 0 Anima. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Anima - Duration=1 round
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Manipulate Earth.MOD			BENEFIT:You can extend your will into the earth, reshaping it as you desire. You can affect a surface area about 10 feet square (to a depth of a few inches) or a volume of about 40 cubic feet. The earth does not gain any special ability to hold its shape against gravity (for example, a narrow arch of earth immediately collapses). The earth does not revert to its original shape on its own, though weather, time and other creatures may affect the earth. The material doesn't have to be topsoil  you can manipulate rocky soil or clay as long as the material is mostly earth and the stones are no larger than a human head. You cannot trap, bury or cover an unwilling creature in earth unless the creature is helpless. You can use this cant to perform certain special attacks. Blind - You can scatter fi ne earth in a 10-foot cube, blinding creatures in the area for 1d4 rounds if they fail a Fortitude save DC %1 (DC 10 + your Charisma modifier). Pummel - You form a sledge or ram out of the earth, which strikes up to four targets in the area. You make a ranged touch attack against each target. If the attack hits, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + your Charisma bonus. Slow - You can form the area into irregular shapes, slowing movement as appropriate for rough terrain (moving out of a square costs two squares of movement). Trip - Make a Strength or Charisma check opposed by the target's Strength or Dexterity check (whichever has the highest ability modifier). All factors that affect a trip attack (target's size, stability, extra legs and so on) apply to this check. If you win, you trip the target. If you lose, the target cannot attempt to trip you in response. You can affect all creatures standing within a 10-foot-square area. You make only one Strength or Charisma check; each target makes an individual check to resist. [Standard Action, Cost 0 Anima, Duration Instantaneous]|10+CHA
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Mindbite.MOD				BENEFIT:Make a ranged touch attack against a target within 10 feet. If you hit, you deal 1d6 points of demonic energy damage. The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or also take two points of Wisdom damage. If you have Corrupting Lash, you may use it and Mindbite as part of the same attack. Scourge: You heal five hit points every time the target takes Wisdom damage from this attack. - Action=Attack - Cost=0 Anima - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Murderous Recharge.MOD			BENEFIT:You gain one Anima when you kill a mortal (including humans, Awakened, mages, vampires and werewolves, but not animals) using Corrupting Lash or Corrupting Matrix. Scourge: You may immediately spend this one Anima to turn the corpse into a zombie minor minion (as if using the Husk Minion cant). You can do this even if you have already reached your limit for spending Anima this round. - Action=Not an action (you can use it even on someone else's turn) - Duration=
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Speed Surge.MOD				BENEFIT:You gain an extra standard or move action in addition to your normal available actions this turn. You can use - Action=Free - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Thrallsight.MOD				BENEFIT:You can project your senses to any one of your thralls, experiencing what he experiences with all five of his senses. Distance is not a factor. The thrall cannot resist this intrusion, though effects that block scrying block your ability to use this cant. The thrall is not aware of this intrusion. You can speak through the thrall for up to one minute (though not otherwise control his actions) by spending one Anima; the thrall can resist with a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). The thrall knows when you speak through him and can hear what you say with his mouth. When your senses are projected into your thrall, you are unable to perceive what happens near your body, though you are aware if you are attacked. Tempter: You may whisper into your thrall's mind while using his senses. Though he cannot telepathically respond, he may speak, and you will hear it with his ears. This effect costs 0 Anima. - Action=Standard - Cost=0 Anima - Duration=Concentration
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Thrallslave.MOD				BENEFIT: You can possess any one of your thralls, at any distance, subsuming his will to your own. The thralls mind is a prisoner during this time, perceiving everything that you do but unable to act. Your body assumes your true form but reverts to its base materials, inert and lifeless. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skill ranks and other abilities that are purely mental (such as resistance to mind-affecting abilities). The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points and natural abilities (natural weapons, modes of breathing and movement and so forth). You cant activate the bodys extraordinary or supernatural abilities and cannot use any of your demonic powers or cants. The thrall gets a Will save to resist this ability (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). A mage, werewolf, vampire or Awakened gets a +4 bonus on his save. Damage to the host also affects your body; you take the same amount of hit point damage, ability damage and ability drain as the host. If the host dies, you return to your body, reduced to 1 hit point and unconscious. You may end the possession at any time, returning to your body instantly, but can continue the possession indefinitely. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Anima - Duration=Until you end it
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Torturous Memory.MOD			BENEFIT:You pull a memory from your target's mind and use this knowledge against her. You must specify an emotional association for the memory: fear, guilt, despair, anger and so on. The target can resist this attack with a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier); success means you cannot learn anything from her mind (but you can try using this cant again on your next turn). If the target fails her save, you read her mind and learn about someone significant to her that is relevant to the emotion you specified. For example, for "fear" you might learn she had an alcoholic abusive father, for "despair" you might learn her husband died in a horrible car accident or for "guilt" you may learn she blames herself for her brother's meth addiction. You learn enough relative details (the person's name, relationship to your target, what happened to him, a few snippets of conversation with the target and so on) to let you speak about this person as if you knew him at least casually. For the next hour, this knowledge gives you a +4 bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate and Charisma checks to influence the target. You may use your knowledge of this memory and your shapechanging powers (if available) to take that person's form, voice and mannerisms (no Disguise roll is needed, as you are using your target's memories as your guide). Upon seeing you in this form, the target must make another Will save or actually believe that you are the person from her memory, no matter how unlikely that is (for example, if the person is dead, you might convince the target that the person is in Hell and therefore under your power), though the target's allies can help convince her otherwise. If the target rolls a 1 on this save, she is absolutely convinced that you are the person from her memory, and she takes a 4 penalty on saves to resist the third part of this cant. In the guise of the memory (whether or not the target believes you), you can try to manipulate the target's emotions. The target resists with a Will save. If the target fails, you can target her with one of the following effects. Despair/Guilt/Sorrow: The target takes a 2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, skill checks and weapon damage rolls. Fear: The target is panicked for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. If cornered, she cowers. Suggestion: You can implant a suggestion in the target's mind to perform an action or actions that can be completed within the hour. The actions must be plausible from the memory-identity's perspective; the abusive alcoholic father isn't going to tell his daughter to pick flowers for an hour, and the addict brother isn't going to tell his sister to blow up a bus full of nuns. Wracked by emotion from her past, no appropriate action is too extreme for the target  even suicide is possible if you can make it a plausible suggestion from the memory-identity. (For example, if her dead husband tells her there is nothing to live for, but if she kills herself at least they'll be together in death.) You can stop the progress of this cant at any point; for example, you could decide to only violate the target's memory and save the other tricks for later, or take the shape of the memoryidentity to lure your target into an alley but not otherwise try to influence her. If you stop the cant and decide to resume later, you must pay the Anima cost to reactivate the cant. You retain the knowledge of the target's memory; if you use the cant again, you can learn a new memory-identity or proceed with the one you already know. Activating this cant is a standard action, though talking with the target to influence her and finally seal the deal may take several minutes. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Anima - Duration=1 hour or until you end it


###Vampire Description
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Aspect of the Predator.MOD		BENEFIT:This ability affects the Predator's Taint that all vampires share (see Chapter 2: Character, "Vampire"). Other vampires perceive you as being at least as powerful as they are, even if you are actually weaker (though they may know otherwise from other sources). You gain a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks. Aspect of the Predator is always active, though you can suppress or reactivate it as a free action once per round. Gangrel: While this Discipline is active, you may use the Intimidate skill to demoralize an opponent as a free action (instead of a standard action) once per round. - Action=None (always active) - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Instantaneous (always active)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Aura Perception.MOD			BENEFIT:You open your perceptions to the psychic auras that surround all sentient creatures (those with Intelligence 3 or higher). Auras are multicolored, each color signifying an emotion or personality aspect; powerful colors tend to drown out weaker ones, but you can still identify multiple colors in any aura. Typical emotions are aggression, anger, bitterness, calm, compassion, confusion, depression, desire, distrust, envy, excitement, fear, happiness, love, lust, obsession, rage, sadness and suspicion. Personality aspects include conservative, generous, idealistic, innocent, psychotic, spiritual or even under the mental control of another (in which case the target's aura is muted). The GM determines what factors are predominant in the target's aura. Supernatural creatures have auras that are different from those of humans. Vampire auras are pale, werewolves' are bright, mages' sparkle with power, demonic auras churn madly and Awakened have sharply defined auras. Thus, this ability allows you to recognize these creatures. Studying a creature's aura requires two full rounds of undisturbed scrutiny. You must be able to see a creature to study its aura. Mekhet: Studying an aura requires only one full round. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Concentration
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Awe.MOD					BENEFIT:You amplify your personality to more easily influence other people. You gain a +5 bonus on social skills (such as most uses of Diplomacy and Gather Information) made to influence or deter others. This Discipline affects everyone who can see you. It does not work through photos, video or other artificial visual means. Even after the effect ends, targets remember their enhanced feelings toward you and are inclined to tailor their future reactions accordingly. (You don't get additional bonuses, but someone who liked you previously doesn't turn against you when you're not around.) Local disturbances and concerns of safety end the effect for nearby targets. (They may be listening with rapt attention but someone drawing a gun on them has a higher priority.) Targets get a Will save to resist this ability (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). When dealing with large numbers of normal humans, make one skill roll with a penalty (4 for 10, 8 for 20, 12 for 50, 16 for 100 or more) rather than individual rolls. Daeva: Targets take a 4 penalty to resist this Discipline. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Blood Potency.MOD			BENEFIT:Your maximum Vitae increases by 10, and the number of Vitae you can spend per round increases by 1. Animal blood is no longer sufficient to provide you Vitae (you must feed on human blood or other vampires). Special: You may take this Discipline up to five times. Its effects stack. If you take this Discipline three times, human blood is no longer sufficient to provide you Vitae (you must feed on Awakened, mages, werewolves or other vampires). If you take this Discipline five times, only vampires with the Blood Potency Discipline provide you Vitae when you feed on them. If you take the Discipline three times, you are no longer subject to Vitae's addictive qualities (as described in Chapter 2: Character, "Vampire," Vitae).
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Body of Spirit.MOD			BENEFIT:You transform yourself, your clothing and small items you carry into a cold mist that moves through force of will. As a mist, you fill a volume equal to a 10-foot-cube and can move along the ground at a speed of 20 feet. You gain cold and fire resistance 5. You are invulnerable to physical attacks, but supernatural attacks may still affect you if they do not rely on a physical form or mundane means. (For example, a spell that makes a blade of hard air cannot harm you, nor do Disciplines that require eye contact, because you have no eyes.) Sunlight deals half damage to you. You cannot physically attack anyone (even another vampire using this ability) or manipulate any physical object, though you may use Disciplines that do not require a body. (Most Dominate Disciplines are useless because you cannot make eye contact.) Your senses are normal despite your lack of eyes and ears. You cannot speak, as you have no mouth. Your mist form is not thick enough to obscure vision. Portions of your misty form cannot be separated from you, and attempts to do so do not harm you. (An enemy cannot bottle a portion of your substance to make you miss a piece when you return to your normal form.) Strong winds can move you against your will if they exceed your movement speed, but they cannot disperse you. Returning to your own form is a standard action. Gangrel: Your Speed in mist form is 30 feet. You may spend to make yourself opaque as thick fog (providing a 50%% miss chance) or return to your normal thinly transparent state, as a free action. - Action=Standard - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Until you return to your normal form
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Call of the Wild.MOD			BENEFIT:You call out in sounds appropriate to a kind of animal (such as wolves or sparrows) to compel animals of that kind to immediately move toward you to the best of their ability. Called animals use the fastest route available to reach you. The animal must hear your voice, so deafened animals or those in soundproofed rooms do not respond. The animals are not under your control but are friendly toward you and receptive to your powers. The number of creatures that arrive depends on your location and the type of creature you summon; hundreds of rats may respond in a city, but you may get only a few dogs from the same location. Unless driven away, the animals remain for at least one minute and act normally for the situation (for example, dogs chase cats, rats crawl on things and so on, but all tend to run from fire or loud noises). Gangrel or Ventrue: You may use Obedience (if you have it) on any one of the animals as a free action. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Celerity.MOD				BENEFIT:You augment your speed and reflexes. Your base speed increases by 30 feet. You gain a +4 dodge bonus to Defense and a +4 bonus on Reflex saves. You can activate this Discipline in response to someone else's actions (on his turn), such as if someone tries to shoot you. Regardless of when you activate Discipline, turn. You cannot activate Celerity more than once per round (for example, to get twice the effect). Special: You may take this Discipline up to five times. Its effects stack. Every time you take it, this Discipline increases the speed, Defense and Reflex save bonus by another increment (+60 feet to base speed, +8 to Defense and +8 on Reflex saves if you take the Discipline twice, and so on). The Vitae cost does not increase. Note that a vampire who has taken this Discipline five times can run at about 80 miles per hour. Daeva or Mekhet: The increase to Defense is +6 per Celerity Discipline instead of +4. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=Until the beginning of your next turn
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Claws of the Wild.MOD			BENEFIT:You grow strong claws on your hands (and feet, if you so choose). These claws are natural weapons that each deal 1d8 damage points of slashing damage. When the claws are out, you gain a +8 equipment bonus on Climb checks. You can retract or extend the claws as a free action. The claws may resemble those of a real animal (wolf, tiger, hawk) or something strange and unearthly. Gangrel: This ability costs 0 Vitae. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Vitae (0 for Gangrel) - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Cloak of Night.MOD			BENEFIT:You fade to invisibility. Anyone in your presence while you are invisible must make a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or ignores you as if you were not there. If you leave a creature's presence and return after a minute or longer, he gets another save to detect you. You may activate this Discipline once per round. Mortals who see you vanish may panic or leave the area in alarm, but most simply come up with a self-deceiving explanation for your absence ("I glanced away, and he must have gone out the door"). If the viewer is a human and rolls a 1 on his save, he forgets that you were ever there. If the viewer is supernatural and rolls a 1 on her save, she believes you slipped away while she was distracted. If you do something to attract attention to yourself (such as shouting a warning, breaking a window or attacking), the effect ends. Otherwise, the Discipline ends when you choose; it even covers for acts that would inadvertently reveal you  crowds subconsciously part to let you pass, listeners ignore you stepping on a squeaky floorboard unless they have already pierced your invisibility and so on. This Discipline works by affecting the mind, not light or other physical properties. For example, video cameras record you normally, but the Discipline affects people looking at you through security devices, and they can't see you until they review the tape out of your presence. Children, animals, the mentally ill and the simple-minded can sometimes see through this obfuscation. A vampire using Auspex can pierce the effect if she beats you in an opposed Will save. Mekhet or Nosferatu: Targets take a 4 penalty to resist this Discipline. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Until you end it.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Cloak of the Gathering.MOD		BENEFIT:This Discipline works similarly to Cloak of Night, except that you can hide up to five other people at once. Each person affected is subject to the rules of Cloak of Night (drawing attention breaks the effect for them, and so on). If you break the cloak, everyone you have hidden becomes visible. Anyone you affect with this ability can see you and each other. If they break line of sight with you, the effect ends for them. Mekhet or Nosferatu: Targets take a 4 penalty to resist this Discipline. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Command.MOD				BENEFIT:You make eye contact with a person and issue a one-word command that he must obey instantly unless he makes a Will save. The command must be clear and straightforward  freeze, jump, run, stop, fall, blink and so on. If the command is ambiguous or confusing, the target may respond slowly or perform the task poorly. The target always interprets the command in his own best interest. For example, if you command a man on a rooftop ledge to "jump," he jumps in place or onto the roof rather than to his death. "Sleep" or other commands that leave the target helpless are effective only if the target believes he is not in any mortal danger, and work for only one round. If the command is something that can be carried out for some time (such as wait, eat or guard), the target complies for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum one round). You may use the command in a sentence so as to disguise the use of this ability, though you must still stress that word so the target knows which command to obey, and those familiar with this Discipline may recognize this tactic. This Discipline does not grant mental communication or guarantee comprehension. Commands must be verbal, though in some cases a gesture and eye movement may be sufficient (such as "come"). You cannot compel a target to obey if she cannot understand you, whether because of a language problem, an inability to hear or an inexplicable command. Because this Discipline requires eye contact, you can use Command on only one creature at a time. A target may announce on his turn that he is avoiding your gaze; doing so means for the next round he has a 50%% chance of not needing to make a save against this Discipline, but you have 20%% concealment against him (because he cannot focus his entire attention on you). Also, on his turn, a creature can shut his eyes, turn his back to you or some similar action that prevents all eye contact; doing so means you have no chance to affect him with this Discipline, but you have 50%% concealment against him (because he is blind to your location). See "Discipline Groups," Dominate, above, for more information on Dominate Disciplines, including certain prohibitions and how to calculate the save DC. Ventrue: The target takes a 4 penalty to resist your command. - Action=Standard - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Until you end it
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Conditioning.MOD				BENEFIT:Over time you can erode a target's will, making her more susceptible to your mental control and resistant to that of others. Conditioning is a slow process, requiring an hour of contact each day for a week. At the end of each week, the target makes a Will save to resist the Conditioning. Each week of successful Conditioning gives the target a 1 penalty to save against any of your Dominate Disciplines, to a maximum penalty of 8. Once the target's penalty reaches 4, you no longer need to make eye contact to use Dominate Disciplines against her (though giving orders through artificial or impersonal means, such as a phone, gives the target a +4 bonus to resist). Conditioned targets are resistant to the mental control of other creatures, and Conditioned targets gain a bonus on Will saves against such effects. The bonus is equal to the penalty they have against your control. Conditioned targets lose much of their ability to think for themselves, as your will blots out much of their personalities. Severely conditioned targets are little more than robots, with no initiative or ability to carry out orders except in the most literal fashion. Each week of Conditioning costs one Vitae. You can Condition multiple targets per week as long as you are able to give them each at least an hour of attention every day. Separation from you tends to erode Conditioning. If one week times the current save penalty passes without the target having contact with you, the penalty drops by 1 (eight weeks at 8 to get to 7, seven weeks at 7 to get to 6 and so on). Another vampire cannot Condition a target until its current conditioning is gone. See "Discipline Groups," Dominate, above, for more information on Dominate Disciplines, including certain prohibitions and how to calculate the save DC. Ventrue: A Conditioned subject's penalty against your Dominate Disciplines is 2 worse than normal and +2 better against those of other vampires, to a maximum of 8/+8. - Action=Standard (to begin the process) - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Dread.MOD					BENEFIT:You can exude a supernatural aura of uncertainty, fear and paranoia. The radius of this aura is 10 feet plus 10 feet per point of your Charisma bonus. The aura remains as long as you concentrate but ends if you attack. Creatures do not need to see you for the aura to affect them, and Dread affects all creatures in range except yourself. Any creature within the aura becomes shaken. On your turn the round after they enter the aura, they must make Will saves (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened and flee for 2d6 rounds; otherwise, they remain shaken but can remain within the aura. A creature that rolls a 1 on its save is panicked rather than frightened. Nosferatu: Targets take a 4 penalty to resist this Discipline. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=Concentration or until you attack
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Entrancement.MOD				BENEFIT:You alter a person's affections toward you, making her admire, trust, love and protective toward you as if you were her best friend or lover. She believes these feelings come from herself and cannot be convinced otherwise. When the effect ends, the target feels displaced and confused (similar to ending a relationship with a lover), leading to mixed feelings; re-Entrancing her is difficult. The target does not feel ill will toward you, she just comes to the conclusion that she no longer feels "that way" about you anymore. The target gets a Will save to resist this ability (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). Entrancement normally lasts about an hour, but if the target rolls a 1 on her save, the Entrancement lasts for at least a week. She has a +5 bonus on her save if you have successfully used this ability on her within the past week. Daeva: The target takes a 4 penalty to resist this Discipline. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=1 hour (possibly longer)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Eye of the Beast.MOD			BENEFIT:You stare into the eyes of a creature, revealing to it a vision of some unnamable horror or torment from beyond the grave. The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or become cowering, remaining in place as long as you are present; if attacked, the creature is panicked and flees for 2d6 rounds. A creature that rolls a 1 on its save is helpless rather than cowering and can do nothing (not even flee) as long as you are present, even if attacked. Nosferatu: The target takes a 4 penalty to resist this Discipline. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=As long as you remain present, or 2d6 rounds
CATEGORY=Special Ability|The Familiar Stranger.MOD		BENEFIT:You meddle with the target's mind so she believes that you are someone she expects under the current circumstances. You do not decide who you "become" and do not know who you have "become," though the target's speech and reactions may allow you to figure it out. As you have no insight to your assumed identity, it is best to keep your contact with the subject brief  good for bluffing your way past a security guard, not so good for pretending to be someone's spouse on an anniversary date. The assumed identity may not even be a specific individual  in some cases, a police officer or a homeless person may be exactly whom the target expects to see, and if the target knows you, she may even expect to see you. This Discipline is an adjustment to perceptions, not an actual physical change. The ability normally lasts no longer than a minute, but you can extend it another minute as a free action by spending one Vitae. The target gets a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) to resist the Discipline. If you know whom she expects (for example, at a business lunch), she takes a 4 penalty on her save. If she makes her save, any further attempt to use this Discipline on her in the next 24 hours costs one Vitae. You can use this ability on several creatures at once, but you must focus on one target as the primary and use her expectation as your guise; all observers who fail their saves perceive you as that target does, even if they don't know whom the primary expects. Affected targets get another save if they actually know the person you "become" and you act contrary to that identity's normal behavior. A target who rolls a 1 on her save fully accepts your guise even if you act contrary to it (she writes off this behavior as joking, drunkenness or some other appropriate explanation). Mekhet or Nosferatu: Targets take a 4 penalty to resist this Discipline. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Feral Whispers.MOD			BENEFIT:You make eye contact with an animal, creating an empathic bond with it and allowing mutual understanding. You must maintain eye contact or a constant vocal dialogue (of words or sounds appropriate to the animal), but the bond otherwise lasts as long as you concentrate. This ability works automatically on passive or friendly animals. A hostile animal requires you to make a check to influence it. You roll 1d20 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier (or make a Diplomacy check, if you have the Way with Animals feat); if you fail you may try again next round. The information you send to or receive from the animal is colored by its intelligence and level of awareness. A cat may be able to explain that many humans scared it out of a nearby building but may not be able to recognize if one of them was wearing a baseball cap or have any real concept of numbers. The animal may help you if it is inclined to do so or understands that you will reward it for doing so (or harm it for not doing so), but most wild creatures are reluctant helpers. Because this Discipline requires eye contact, you cannot use Feral Whispers on more than one animal at once. Gangrel or Ventrue: You gain a +4 bonus on your check to influence a hostile animal. - Action=Standard - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Concentration
CATEGORY=Special Ability|The Forgetful Mind.MOD			BENEFIT:You make eye contact and speak to a person, acting similarly to a hypnotist, asking questions to draw forth memories and describing in detail the changes you wish to make in those memories. Simple alterations such as blurring a recent memory (as when you fed upon the target) are easy, while more complicated alterations (such as a complete reconstruction of the target's personality) require extended time and more work. The target's mind struggles against an implanted memory, though realistic details make it more likely to take root. For example, if you feed on a businessman in a parking lot and then implant the false memory of "you had a bad day and drove home" to cover your presence, the memory is not likely to hold up to scrutiny, but a carefully described memory (including details about why the day was bad, what traffic was like and an overplayed song on the radio) is more stable. The target gets 147 a Will save to resist this Discipline, and the GM may impose a DC modifier from +4 (difficult) to 4 (easy) based on the plausibility of the changes. Clumsy users may simply sift through the target's responses and erase certain parts, but this leaves gaps that the target may attempt to resolve when he discovers them. Erased memories may haunt the target in dreams or flashbacks, particularly if they were vivid. After months or years of therapy and investigation, even detailed false memories may break down. You can also use this Discipline to determine if someone's memory has been altered. Make a Search check (the DC equals the Will save DC of the altered memory). For example, a vampire implants a very plausible memory (DC 20); for you to notice it, you must make a DC 20 Search check while using The Forgetful Mind. Once you recognize it, you can use this Discipline to restore the original memories using the same procedure as planting false ones, but the DC decreases by 4. You must concentrate to use this ability. The process lasts as long as you take to describe the new or restored memories. As with hypnotism, the target must be relaxed and comfortable for this to work. At the start, you must have eye contact, but once the effect is established you need only speak to the target. The target must be able to understand you. Because this Discipline requires eye contact to initiate, you can only use The Familiar Mind on one creature at a time. A target may avoid your gaze as described in the Command Discipline. See "Discipline Groups," Dominate, above, for more information on Dominate Disciplines, including certain prohibitions and how to calculate the save DC. Ventrue: The target takes a 4 penalty to resist your alterations. - Action=Standard (plus the time to describe the altered memory) - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Haven of Soil.MOD			BENEFIT:You merge your body with any volume of soil that could normally hold your body. You must be able to make direct contact with the soil (e.g., if the soil is under a wooden floor or a sidewalk you must first break through this barrier). You are not merely buried; your physical essence is distributed throughout the material. Digging does not discover you. You cannot be harmed when merged this way, even by magic or sunlight. When merged, you are asleep. If enough of your confining material is disturbed, it alerts you to the disturbance, wakes you and ejects you from your haven (usually in a shower of the material). When you are merged, all attempts to locate you (even by scent or supernatural means) take a 10 penalty (or you gain a +10 bonus on your save to resist). Even if searchers find your general location, they still aren't able to find your body because it no longer exists as a discrete object. You decide the duration when you activate this Discipline, though a disturbance can wake you earlier, as described above. Emerging from your haven is a free action if you initiate it and does not require an action if emerging is in response to a disturbance. When you emerge, you must spend one Vitae to awaken (as if waking at sundown). You emerge from the same direction you entered unless that direction is now blocked; for example, you cannot fuse with a stone wall and emerge on the other side. Special: You can select this Discipline multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you select this Discipline again, you learn two other types of material into which you can merge. Available materials are wood, water, natural stone, processed stone (including asphalt) and metal; you cannot learn processed stone until you have learned natural stone, and cannot learn metal until you learn processed stone. In any case, the volume of the material must be as large as your body. If you meld with water, you leave a barely visible, humanoid-shaped outline just below the surface but are otherwise protected and concealed as with any other appropriate material. Gangrel: Each time you select this Discipline (including the first time), you may learn one additional medium that you may use as a haven. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=Indefinite
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Heightened Senses.MOD			BENEFIT:You magnify your senses to a superhuman level, giving you a +5 bonus on Listen, Search and Spot checks. At the GM's discretion you may get this bonus on other skill checks as well (Sense Motive checks, for example). When your sight is heightened, you have darkvision (60 feet) and your low-light vision range is doubled, so you see four times as far as a normal human in low light conditions. While your senses are heightened, you are vulnerable to attacks on those senses, taking a 4 penalty on saves to resist such attacks and suffering whatever additional effect the attack has against vulnerable creatures. You may selectively amplify only some of your senses (instead of all of them at once) to reduce the number of possible sources. Adjusting which senses are magnified is a free action. Mekhet: The bonus on Listen, Search and Spot checks is +8 rather than +5. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Concentration
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Leashing the Beast.MOD			BENEFIT:You fly into a rage, temporarily gaining a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. (The extra hit points from the Constitution increase are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity- or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate and Ride), the Concentration skill, Disciplines or any abilities that require patience or concentration. You can use any feat except Combat Expertise. Discipline ing   A fit of rage lasts for one minute. You may prematurely end your rage by spending one Vitae; otherwise, you continue to attack any creature within reach, even allies. As a standard action, you may invoke this rage in another creature within line of sight. The target gets a Will save to resist (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). The target's rage continues for the full duration unless the target has this Discipline (and may therefore end its rage) or someone else intervenes with supernatural powers. You may use this Discipline to end a state of fear or rage in yourself. As a standard action, you may remove fear or rage from another creature within line of sight. Such a creature can resist with a Will save if it desires. Gangrel or Ventrue: You may end your rage without spending Vitae. - Action=Free (affect yourself) or standard (affect another creature) - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=1 minute (rage) or instantaneous (ending fear or rage)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Mask of Tranquility.MOD		BENEFIT:You conceal your vampire nature from all supernatural forms of detection, causing others to perceive you as a normal human. For example, other vampires do not automatically recognize you as a vampire with the Predator's Taint; a vampire using Aura Perception shows your aura as strong and colorful as a human. This Discipline does not affect your ability to detect other vampires or prevent more overt means of detection  you do not bleed, sunlight burns you and so on. This ability is always active, though you may turn it on or off as a free action. This is an all-or-nothing change; you cannot have some aspects of Mask of Tranquility active and others not. If someone is using Auspex or other active supernatural means to detect that you are a vampire, make an opposed Will save; if you win, the other does not detect that you are a vampire. Mekhet or Nosferatu: You do not have to spend Vitae to give yourself the semblance of life (see Chapter 2: Character, "Vampire," Vitae). - Action=None (always active) - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Instantaneous (always active)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Mesmerize.MOD				BENEFIT:You make eye contact with a person and implant a suggestion in his mind. The suggestion may be immediate ("walk over here and unlock this door"), extended ("follow this man, take notes on his actions, and report back to me at the end of the month") or triggered ("when the man with the blue suit and red tie enters the room, spill your drink on him"). Impossible tasks ("count all the grains of sand on this beach") automatically fail. The target gets a Will save to resist. He gets another save if performing the task puts him in danger or forces him to compromise his moral code. Only one suggestion can be in effect at a time. A second suggestion from you automatically overrides the first. A suggestion from another vampire (or other supernatural force) requires the target to save against both commands; if he fails the other vampire's save but makes yours, he abandons your task to work on the other's, but otherwise he ignores the other vampire's suggestion to work on yours. See "Discipline Groups," Dominate, above, for more information on Dominate Disciplines, including certain prohibitions and how to calculate the save DC. Ventrue: The target takes a 4 penalty to resist your suggestion. - Action=Standard - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Until the task ends
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Monstrous Countenance.MOD		BENEFIT:You bare your fangs, make a threatening noise and gain a horrifying visage. Any creature viewing you must make a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened for a number of rounds equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. The target gets another save every round after the first to stop fleeing but still refuses to come within sight of you for the duration. The viewers must have line of sight to you; seeing you in a mirror, photo or television is no more frightening than any other "special effect." You may resume your normal appearance as a free action, though this does not cause those already affected to recover. Nosferatu: Targets take a 4 penalty to resist this Discipline. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Until you end it
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Mortal Fear.MOD				BENEFIT:You trigger the target's most primal fears. You engage the reptile part of his brain, flooding his body with erratic nerve impulses, adrenaline and coagulated supernatural terror. These factors combine to cause a horrible shock: the target ages prematurely, his hair turns white and he may even have a heart attack and die from the strain on his body. This Discipline deals 5d6 points of damage (this damage bypasses physical defenses and damage reduction does not affect it); the target may make a Will save for half damage (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). If he rolls a 1 on his save, he also takes two points of Constitution damage and two points of Wisdom damage. The target must be able to see you for this Discipline to work, though seeing your silhouette or just your face is sufficient. You can use Mortal Fear on a particular target only once every 10 minutes. Even if multiple witnesses are present, this Discipline affects only one target; all others see you staring intently but suffer no adverse reactions. You can use this Discipline only once per round. Nosferatu: Targets take a 4 penalty to resist this Discipline. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Obedience.MOD				BENEFIT:You make eye contact with an animal, allowing you to telepathically convey a command to it and tell it exactly what you want it to do. The animal obeys to the best of its ability, but the animal's intelligence and nature may cause it to interpret your command in unusual ways. Once you give the order, the animal carries it out, assuming it can be completed before sunrise. At sunrise, the compulsion ends, regardless of whether or not the task is finished. The animal gets a Will save (the DC is your Hit Dice + your Charisma bonus) to resist any order to act against its nature or to obviously cause itself harm. Because this Discipline requires eye contact, you cannot command more than one animal at once, but you can command multiple animals in sequence and have them act at the same time. Gangrel or Ventrue: You may command up to two animals at once if you give them the same order. - Action=Standard - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Until the order is completed or sunrise, whichever comes first
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Possession.MOD				BENEFIT:This power goes beyond spoken commands. You make eye contact and crush the victim's will, taking over his body like a malevolent spirit. The target's mind is in a dream state during this time, perceiving everything that you do (perhaps in a distorted fashion) but not quite sure how real it is. Your body is helpless and appears to be nothing but a corpse. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skill ranks and other abilities that are purely mental (such as resistance to mind-affecting abilities). The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points and natural abilities (natural weapons, modes of breathing and movement, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities and cannot use Disciplines. The target gets a Will save to resist this ability. A demon, mage, werewolf or Awakened gets a +4 bonus on his save. This Discipline does not work on vampires. While possessing the target, you can travel safely during the day, though you must still spend one Vitae as normal to remain awake during the day. Damage to the host, including ability damage and ability drain, also affects your body. If the host dies, you return to your body, reduced to 1 hit point and unconscious. You may end the possession at any time, returning to your body instantly, but can continue the possession indefinitely (though you cannot feed in the host and you must continue to spend Vitae to awaken as normal, so extended stays leave your body depleted). See "Discipline Groups," Dominate, above, for more information on Dominate Disciplines, including certain prohibitions and how to calculate the save DC. Ventrue: The target takes a 4 penalty to resist your possession attempt. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=Until you end it
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Resilience.MOD				BENEFIT:You give yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution and the benefits of the Diehard and Endurance feats. (The extra hit points from the Constitution bonus are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) Special: You may take this Discipline up to five times. Its effects stack. Every time you take it, it increases your Constitution bonus by another increment (+8 for two Disciplines, +12 for three, and so on). The Vitae cost does not increase. Gangrel or Ventrue: When the Discipline ends, you automatically heal 3d6 points of damage. This effect occurs before your Constitution score drops to normal. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Revelation.MOD				BENEFIT:[Free Action, Cost 1 Vitae, Duration is Instantaneous] You speak a few heartfelt words or give a compassionate look to a single person, which causes the target to confess things he normally keeps private. The target gets a Will save DC %1 to resist this ability (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). He takes a -5 penalty on his save if he is currently subject to your Awe or Entrancement, a +5 bonus if you are his enemy and another +5 bonus if you have inflicted violence upon him within the past day. The nature of what the target reveals is determined by your words and actions before using this ability. (If you were talking about fears, the target reveals his fears and so on.) The target continues to reveal these private feelings each round until you stop him or he makes a Will save; each round after the fi rst gives him a cumulative +1 bonus on this save. You can steer the conversation to other subjects (and other types of secrets). If the target's initial save against this ability is a 1, he cannot stop from exposing all of his secrets to you, stopping only when you direct him to or he runs out of secrets. The target remembers that he confessed but may not understand why he did so and may take action later to correct this "error in judgment." [Daeva - The target takes a -4 penalty to resist this Discipline.]|HD+CHA+10
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Shatter the Mind.MOD			BENEFIT:You awaken the target's thoughts to the most horrific thing she can imagine, turning her subconscious mind against the conscious. The target imagines her greatest fear coming to pass at that moment, no matter how implausible or nonsensical that fear may be (such as drowning on a city sidewalk). The target must see you, but you do not need to make eye contact. The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be dazed for one round and gain a mild derangement (psychological disorder; GM's discretion) for a number of weeks equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1); if the target already has a derangement, the GM may instead upgrade the derangement to a more severe form for the duration. If the target rolls a 1 on her save, she falls unconscious for one minute and when she wakes she has a severe derangement; this condition does not wear off without therapy or supernatural intervention. Mild derangements include Bulimia, Depression, Fixation, Inferiority Complex, Irrationality, Narcissism, Phobias and Suspicion. Severe derangements include Anxiety, Hysteria, Manic Depression, Megalomania, Melancholy, Multiple Personality Disorder, Obsessive Compulsion, Paranoia and Schizophrenia. You can use Shatter the Mind on a particular target only once per day. Nosferatu: Targets take a 4 penalty to resist this Discipline. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=Instantaneous (dazed) plus one week per point of Charisma modifier (derangement)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Sovereignty.MOD				BENEFIT:You augment your personality and presence so that only the strongest-willed have any chance to disobey you. This Discipline affects anyone with line of sight to you, even if just a part is visible or if you are screened in some way (such as by a translucent curtain). Sovereignty has two levels of power. Passive: People feel a zealous fear of or devotion to you; this effect is always active (though you can deactivate or reactivate it as a free action). They may speak freely around you as long as they don't defy or criticize you, and their demeanor is obviously affected by your Sovereignty. Active: Your presence is almost a physical weight upon any who oppose you  socially, physically or supernaturally. If someone tries to attack you (socially, physically or supernaturally), you may trigger the active level of the Discipline (even if it is not your turn). A would-be attacker gets a Will save to resist the active effect (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). If he succeeds, he may attack you for the remainder of the night without making saves against your Sovereignty. Failure means he may try to attack again next round by attempting another save; he takes a 4 penalty on his save for each failed attempt to attack you that night. If he rolls a 1 on his save, he cannot attempt to attack you for the rest of the night; the attacker is humbled and stifled, unable to speak out against you in any way. Any other would-be attackers during this time must save against your power to proceed, but these additional attacks do not cost you extra Vitae. If someone attacks after this one-hour period, you may reactivate the full power of this Discipline. If you physically or supernaturally attack someone, your Sovereignty (passive and active) is broken with respect to that target only, and he may retaliate freely without saving against this Discipline. However, you may criticize, berate or insult someone without breaking either level of Sovereignty. Daeva: Targets take a 4 penalty to resist this Discipline. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Vitae (passive effect) or 1 Vitae (full effect) - Duration=Instantaneous (passive level) or 1 hour (active level)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|The Spirit's Touch.MOD			BENEFIT:By handling an object and entering a light trance, you pick up psychic impressions from the object in the form of mental images or rapid sensations. Most impressions come from the last person to have handled the object, but two circumstances overrule this. First, a long-time owner or user of the object leaves a stronger impression than a more recent but shorter use by someone else. Second, experiences associated with strong emotion leave more significant psychic "fingerprints," overriding those from more casual use. Some items have so many handlers or insignificant attachment that they give muddled images or none at all. The typical impression you receive is the owner's identity or a strong memory associated with the object. The sensations are usually visual and exact identification is not guaranteed; you may perceive "a blond man in a business suit and red tie" rather than "Jack Hartman of Hartman Law Partners," though mundane clues on the object may allow you to identify him, such as a monogrammed briefcase or a name tag. The images may be brief or run a minute or more depending on the intensity and relevance of the psychic impression. You can use this ability on a creature to witness its most recent dramatic, tense or passionate act. You must touch the target, and it receives a Will save to resist %1. Especially intense and recent impressions may give the target a penalty to its save at the GM's discretion. You perceive the events from the target's viewpoint. Mekhet: You may delve deeper into an object's or creature's impressions, receiving a second image or vision that is weaker than the first. - Action=Full round - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Concentration|10+TL+WIS
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Subsume the Lesser Spirit.MOD	BENEFIT:You make eye contact and psychically enter an animal's body, temporarily leaving yours behind. The animal's body is under your complete control; your own body appears to be nothing more than a lifeless corpse. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, base attack bonus, base save bonuses and skill ranks, and other abilities that are purely mental (such as resistance to mind-affecting abilities). The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points and natural abilities (natural weapons, modes of breathing and movement and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The animal gets a Will save to resist this ability (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier); the animal takes a 4 penalty if it is a predator. While in the animal's body, you can use any Animalism Discipline. If the possessed animal rolled a 1 on its Will save, you may also use Auspex and Majesty Disciplines while possessing the animal. While possessing the animal, you can travel safely during the day, though you must still spend one Vitae as normal to remain awake during the day. Damage to the animal, including ability damage and ability drain, also affects your body (you take the same amount of damage the body does). If the animal is killed, you are forced back to your body, reduced to 1 hit point and knocked unconscious. You may end the possession at any time, returning to your body instantly, but can continue the possession indefinitely (though you cannot feed as an animal and you must continue to spend Vitae to awaken as normal, so extended stays leave your body depleted). Gangrel or Ventrue: You may use this ability on an animal in your line of sight without requiring eye contact. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=Until you end it
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Summoning.MOD				BENEFIT:You reach out to anyone who knows you and telepathically urge him to attend your presence immediately. The call can reach anyone in the world, though a distant target takes longer to get to you. The target takes the most direct route to you and knows where to go even if you change locations (similar to a psychic directional sense), though he doesn't necessarily know the final destination. The target knows who summons him but not why. He may pause to make arrangements before departing (such as calling in sick to work) but otherwise travels as fast as reasonably possible  he is no single-minded drone willing to drive 100 miles per hour through city streets to get to you. If he has the means to contact you (such as your phone number), he may do so. The effect of the summoning fades at sunrise, as does the subject's awareness of your direction. If you want the subject to continue beyond sunrise, you need to use this ability again (though a target inclined to help you may continue on his own volition during daylight hours). If the subject does not wish to go to you, he may use the daylight hours to get farther from you. A vampire under this Discipline's effect makes normal plans to avoid the coming day. The target gets a Will save to resist this ability (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). The target gets a +4 bonus on his save if he is your enemy, a +4 bonus if he is more than 500 miles away and a +4 bonus if he has urgent business that answering the summons would ruin. If the target rolls a 1 on his save, the effect persists even through daylight (including the direction sense) and you do not need to reinstate the Summoning each sundown (though affected vampires still avoid the daylight). Daeva: The target takes a 4 penalty to resist this Discipline. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=Until sunrise (perhaps longer)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Telepathy.MOD				BENEFIT:You can create a telepathic link with another person as a free action, allowing you to communicate with her mentally. This communication is two-way; you and the other person may send and receive thoughts. The target recognizes that your communication comes from outside her mind, though she may not realize you are the source of the words (though the mental "voice" sounds like your real voice). The target must be within view when you activate this Discipline, and the effect is broken if she moves out of sight for more than one round; otherwise, the link lasts as long as you concentrate. An unwilling target can end the link with a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). You can use the link to read the target's thoughts against her will. Each round, you can read the target's surface thoughts (a Will save resists this attempt); you can probe for thoughts or memories the target isn't actively thinking about, but she gets a +4 bonus on her save. You can try to read thoughts each round the link is active. The link counts as a sympathetic conduit for mind-affecting magic (see Chapter 5: Magic, "Spells," Spell Range). Mekhet: You can remain in contact with a target even if she is out of your line of sight for up to one minute. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Vitae (willing target), 1 Vitae (unwilling targets) - Duration=Until you end it
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Touch of Shadow.MOD			BENEFIT:[Free Action, Cost 0 Vitae, Duration of 1 minute] You conceal on your person an object of Diminutive or smaller size. The item is undetectable even if it is in plain sight (such as a pack of cigarettes held in your open palm). Anyone trying to find the concealed object must make a Will save DC %1 (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) to find the item. Furthermore, he must know exactly what he is looking for (such as a pack of cigarettes, a knife, a pistol, a bag of drugs and so on); a nonspecific search fails to turn up anything. Smaller objects increase the DC by +4 per size category, larger ones decrease the DC by -4 per size category. If you draw attention to the object (such as by pointing at it or deliberately showing it to someone), the concealment ends. A person who spots the object can point it out to others, giving them a +4 bonus on their saves, but anyone who rolls a 1 on his save cannot see the object despite all attempts. As with Cloak of Shadow, this Discipline is a mental effect rather than a physical one. Because the ability is nonphysical, you cannot conceal an object and hide another object behind the first object; the other object is clearly visible. [Mekhet or Nosferatu: Creatures have a -4 penalty to resist this Discipline.]|TL+CHA+10
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Twilight Projection.MOD		BENEFIT:You project your senses out of your physical body, creating an astral form or ghost body. In this form, you are invisible and invulnerable but cannot physically interact with the world. You may travel anywhere in moments, including underground or miles into the air (though not beyond the orbit of the moon or to another dimension). If you encounter another vampire using this ability or a supernatural creature with a similar power, you can see and communicate with each other as if you were in the real world, but you cannot harm each other in any way. You cannot use Disciplines or other supernatural abilities when in the ghost body. Your projection looks like you but is naked and has no possessions. Supernatural objects with strong ties to souls may have a residual manifestation if you project while carrying them, but this manifestation is cosmetic, and the objects have no abilities in projected form. You are invisible to most creatures and can be detected as an invisible creature by supernatural methods (see Chapter 7: Playing the Game, "Special Abilities," Invisibility). Children, animals and the mentally ill or deficient may be able to see you, as may a vampire using Aura Perception or Heightened Senses. While your consciousness roams, your physical body lies inert and lifeless as a corpse. While projected, you do not know what is happening to or near your body. If your body is reduced to 1 hit point or below, your projection immediately returns to your body. Your body spends one Vitae at sundown even if your consciousness is not within your body. Certain supernatural effects may bar your projection from returning to your body or take over your body while your projection is absent, preventing you from using your body. Each full day that you are denied your body against your will reduces your Charisma by two points; when your Charisma reaches 0, your projection fades into oblivion, and you die. Mekhet: Your projected form may appear naked or clothed as your body currently is. By spending one Vitae, you can make yourself visible to a single creature for up to one minute, though this does not allow you to communicate verbally or telepathically (though you can still gesture or even use sign language). - Action=Free - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=Until you end it
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Vigor.MOD					BENEFIT:You give yourself a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and a +5 bonus on Jump checks (in addition to the Jump bonus from your improved Strength). Special: You may take this Discipline up to five times. Its effects stack. Every time you take it, it increases your Strength and Jump bonuses by another increment (+8 Strength and +10 on Jump checks for two Disciplines, +12 and +15 for three and so on). The Vitae cost does not increase. Daeva or Nosferatu: The Strength bonus for each Vigor Discipline is +6 instead of +4. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=1 minute

# Devotions
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Body of Will.MOD				BENEFIT:You can temporarily ignore pain and other physical effects. You are not numb to all sensation and are still aware if you take damage, but your will overrides your body's limitations. You can ignore following conditions while you use this devotion: dazed, exhausted, fatigued, staggered and stunned. You do not lose hit points for acting while disabled. All ignored effects resume when the devotion ends. - Action=None (you can activate this ability when it is not your turn, even in response to an attack that causes one of these conditions) - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=10 minutes
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Instantaneous Transformation.MOD	BENEFIT:You may change form as a free action instead of a standard action. - Action=None - Cost=0 Vitae - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Iron Facade.MOD				BENEFIT:You shrug off wounds, debilitating injuries and other effects that make you less than at your best. That is, you appear to do so  it is actually a carefully built illusion only partly based on reality. You appear to be uninjured. You ignore penalties to your movement stemming from injuries (such as caltrops or a broken leg) but not from other sources (for example, wading through cement or wearing leg shackles still slows you). If injuries or other effects occur after you activate this Discipline, they appear to heal instantly. This devotion only masks the extent of the damage; this devotion does not heal damage. The devotion is strong enough to let you run on a shattered leg (perhaps giving you time to escape a dangerous enemy), laugh off shotgun blast to the chest (even if it reduces you to one hit point) or even walk through sunlight (though your flesh appears to boil away and re-grow instantly). This devotion does not protect you from effects, injuries or hit point damage that would knock you unconscious or kill you (though for the duration you appear to be a strangely intact corpse). All masked injuries reappear as soon as the devotion ends. You gain a +10 bonus on Intimidate checks against anyone who sees you "heal" with this devotion. Any human who sees you "heal" immediately realizes that something is unnatural about you (and the normal human reaction is to flee). A demon, mage, werewolf, vampire or Awakened who sees you do this probably assumes you are very powerful or at least guarded by powerful magic  unless he knows about this devotion, of course. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Quicken Sight.MOD			BENEFIT:You gain a +12 bonus on Search and Spot checks regarding fast-moving objects that would otherwise be a blur. Following a particular card in a shuffle is a trivial task, subliminal messages are as clear as a newspaper headline and you can read a newspaper headline as you drive by at 60 miles per hour. You also get a +5 bonus on Search and Spot checks regarding sight of slow or stationary objects. (This bonus does not stack with the bonus from Heightened Senses, though you can still use that Discipline to improve your hearing, touch and so on.) - Action=None (you can activate this ability when it is not your turn) - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Veridical Tongue.MOD			BENEFIT:You negate the target's ability to lie. She can remain silent, but if she speaks, it can only be the truth as she knows it. The subject does not have a supernatural sense of truth; if what she knows is actually false, she speaks as if it were true. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Vitae - Duration=1 minute

###Block: Werewolf Mods ----------------------------------------
# Ability Name								Description of the Benefits
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Alien Fury.MOD				BENEFIT:You invoke thoughts of your homeworld's strange moon, filling yourself with its power. You gain a +8 dodge bonus to Defense and a +8 bonus on attack rolls. Your eyes, fangs and claws blaze with a strange white energy resembling fire. You can use this rite in combination with a normal rage as long as you activate the rite first (though this combination lasts only one round, as you cannot activate rites while raging). - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 round
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Alien Speed.MOD				BENEFIT:You increase your base speed by +30 feet in human or hybrid form, or +40 feet in beast form. You get a +8 dodge bonus to Defense against ranged attacks. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Anybeast.MOD				BENEFIT:With this rite you skew your appearance so you resemble another animal rather than a wolf. For example, you may look more like a tiger, hyena, bear and so on. These are not perfect imitations of Earth creatures any more than your beast form is a perfect imitation of a wolf. In hybrid form, you resemble a cross between human and your new beast form. Your size does not change (you are still Medium), so taking wolverine or elephant form results in a creature of the wrong size. Your basic shape as a biped/quadruped does not change, so pretending to be a weresnake (no limbs) or werespider (eight limbs) is impossible. You can drop the disguise as a free action, reverting to your normal shape for your current form (dropping a man-tiger hybrid shape means you take on your normal manwolf hybrid form). Each time you use this rite, you may adopt a new temporary form (you are not limited to one specific new form when you learn this rite). - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=10 minutes or until you end it (a free action)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Attunement.MOD				BENEFIT:You gain an intuitive understanding of the target's combat ability. You get a +2 bonus on attack rolls against the target; you get an additional +2 bonus for each Primal Urge rite you have (to a maximum of +12). The target gets a Will save to resist (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier). - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Aura of Truce.MOD			BENEFIT:You soothe flaring tempers and establish a mood that facilitates arbitration to violence. It is especially effective if one party wishes to talk and the other prefers to fight. Targets may resist with a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier + 2 for every target willingly accepting the effect). Failure means the target cannot attack, use a rite to harm another or even damage property (though non-hostile "damage" such as eating offered food is not prohibited); success means the target can act normally. You may end the effect as a free action, which ends the effect for everyone. If you attack an affected target, the effect ends for everyone. You must be able to see a target to affect him, though affected targets do not need to see each other. Once violence has broken out, you cannot use this rite to stop it (though you can still restrain or talk-down a malcontent). - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=10 minutes or until ended
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Between the Weave.MOD			BENEFIT:The Intrusion stretched and snapped the supernatural material that separates our universe from others. In some places, this weakness is apparent by the strange abilities  it manifests, and with careful effort, you can slip through one of these points and use it as a hiding place or a way to travelsecretly. When at an area affected by the Intrusion (or Nightmare Wave), you can make a DC 20 Will save to squeeze through this point of weakness and enter a place called the Gauntlet, a strange barrier zone between the Earth's dimension and somewhere else. The GM may decide that the affected area is more or less damaged than a typically weakened area and assign a bonus or penalty on your save (anywhere from +4 to 4). You can bring only what you can carry, and not another creature. The tainted area must be at least as large as your body. When in the Gauntlet, you are invisible and invulnerableto attack from things outside it, but you cannot take any actions against anything outside the Gauntlet. You may target yourself with skills or supernatural abilities as normal. You may move  through the Gauntlet at your normal speed, though physicalobjects in the Earth-universe still block your progress (for example, you cannot use the Gauntlet to walk through walls, but you can walk through an open doorway as easily as if you were in the Earth-dimension). While in the Gauntlet, you do not leave a scent. The Gauntlet plays havoc with your senses while you are there. Though you can perceive things outside the Gauntlet, they are often distorted, brightly colored, patterns of shadow or even stranger things: ghosts crushed into the shapes of walls and doors. These images are not harmful and do not affect yourability to move in the Gauntlet or relate to Earth-dimension features, but such images may be distracting or frightening. Some werewolves speculate these distortions are just another aspectof the Intrusion; some think it's the influence of a neighboringdimension. Most don't care. Once you pierce the edge of reality, you can remain there for only a short time (up to one round per point of your Wisdom bonus, minimum one round), after which you return automatically. You can return earlier than this as a free action. When you leave the Gauntlet, you arrive at the equivalent Earth-dimension location; therefore, this rite is handy for waiting out a short danger or getting a head start against pursuers but not so good at breaking into sealed areas such as bank vaults. Some large areas of damaged reality may allow you to remain in the Gauntlet longer. Transitioning back to the Earth-dimension is disorienting; once you do so, you cannot take any more actions during that round. It may be possible to use the Gauntlet to reach other dimensions, but no werewolf who has tried has ever returned. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 round per point of Wisdom bonus (minimum 1) or until you end it
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Bind or Sunder.MOD			BENEFIT:You can manipulate a target's delicate control over her form-changing. Doing so has one of two effects. Extend: If the target is a werewolf, you can extend the maximum time she may spend it hybrid form, just as if you were using Fuel Rage on yourself. The target gets no save to resist this effect, as the target always has the option to change form even if you extend her maximum possible time as a hybrid (though she must make a DC 20 Will save to do so, as described in Chapter 2: Character, "Werewolf"). You cannot use this aspect of the rite on anything other than a werewolf. Suppress: If the target is a creature not in its natural form (whether demon, mage, vampire or anything else), you can  force the target to assume its natural form. The target may resistwith a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). Failure means that the target assumes its natural form and cannot change shape for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). If another creature tries to change the target's form (such as a mage using a spell) while this ban is in effect, the acting creature must make a Will save to override the rite. You must have line of sight to the target to affect it. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 round per point Wisdom bonus (minimum 1)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Blending.MOD				BENEFIT:You can make Hide checks even when you have no cover or concealment; anyone who fails her Spot check fails to see you or believes you to be an unremarkable feature of the landscape. You cannot move when using this rite. You cannot use it to hide while someone is observing you (though you may hide if she is merely in the area rather than looking  specifically at you).- Action=Free (using the Hide skill still is part of your move action) - Cost=0 Essence - Duration=Until you move
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Break the Defiant.MOD			BENEFIT:You growl menacingly, chilling the target to the bone. The target gets a Will save to partially resist (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). Success means she takes four points of Wisdom damage; failure means she takes eight points of Wisdom damage. If she rolls a 1 on her save, she gets no save against the next rite you use on her that normally allows a Will save to resist. You cannot use this rite on someone more than once per  day. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Bystander.MOD				BENEFIT:You become a face in the crowd, failing to attract attention to yourself as an unexceptional example of the people around you, even if your appearance or personal hygiene would indicate otherwise. An Irraka wearing blood-spattered sweatpants and a T-shirt could walk through a Wall Street brokerage firm without attracting attention, as anyone who sees him thinks he sees another "suit." The effect ends if you draw attention to yourself (such as kicking open an emergency exit door or attacking someone; even a helpful action such as pulling someone out of the way of an oncoming car) unless that action is appropriate for a typical bystander in the environment; drawing a gun on an armed attacker is unusual for a typical man on the street but perfectly ordinary if you're surrounded by police officers or at an NRA convention. Otherwise, the effect remains active even if you interact with others in an unobtrusive manner (chatting with others on an elevator, waving to a security guard and so on). This rite doesn't fool security devices such as retinal scanners, voice scanners or key-code locks, but does fool facial-recognition software trying to pick you out of a crowd. It may be foiled by something as simple as signing a logbook or handing over a bus ticket if you cannot cover for these actions (by signing an illegible name or name that is known at the area, providing abus ticket or paper that looks like a bus ticket, and so on). Finally, the rite fails if the area includes no bystanders with whom you can mingle, such as a security checkpoint near the Intrusion or a company's board meeting (though you might be able to crash a small invitation-only party by mingling with the caterers). Someone using supernatural means of awareness or actively trying to recognize you as not belonging gets a Will save to resist (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier); if he rolls a 1 on his save, he fails to remember you were present at all. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=10 minutes or until you end it
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Call of Glory.MOD			BENEFIT:You can let loose a supernatural howl that rejuvenates nearby packmates. Any werewolf packmate (including yourself) who hears you immediately heals 8d6 points of damage. A nonwerewolf packmate who hears you heals 4d6 points of damage. This rite only works if the targets hear your voice directly; hearing you in a recording or over the phone is insufficient. - Action=Free - - Cost=1 Essence - - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Command Fire.MOD				BENEFIT:You can bend and shape any open flame, even arcing it through the air to strike an object or creature. Attacking with flame in this way requires a ranged touch attack and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per point of your Charisma bonus (minimum 1d6). By concentrating and making a DC 0 Will save, you can cause a large fire to spread faster or slower. For every 5 points you exceed the DC, you cause the fire to expand into or stay out of one five-foot-square area for one round. (For example, if you roll a 20, you can cause a large fire to advance into an additional four squares or stay out of four squares.) - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=Instantaneous (fire attack) or concentration (manipulate large fire)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Crashing the Gates.MOD			BENEFIT:This rite works similarly to Between the Weave, except you can bring up to four other people with you. Each person coming with you must be willing, conscious and touching you. Any Ithaeur werewolf brought with you can return on his own, but all other passengers remain until you bring them back or the rite's duration expires. Humans (normal humans, not Awakened or mages) find the Gauntlet disturbing and must make DC 15 Will saves or be shaken for one minute after leaving it. - Action=Instantaneous - Cost=1 Essence per person (including yourself) - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Crushing Blow.MOD			BENEFIT:Your unarmed attacks and attacks with melee weapons deal +4 points of damage. You gain the benefits of the Improved Unarmed Strike feat. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Death Grip.MOD				BENEFIT:You focus your energy into your jaws, making them the perfect agent for restraining your prey. You do not provoke an attack of opportunity for initiating a grapple (provided you use your bite to do so). In this grapple, as long as you do not speak, use a rite requiring a howl or bite a different creature, you can lock your jaws and get a +8 bonus on grapple checks against your prey. You can still use your bite as a natural attack to damage your prey (by making an opposed grapple check) without releasing this hold. You must be in hybrid or beast form to use this rite. - Action=Free (though you still must use an attack to start a grapple) - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute or until you let go with your bite
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Double Back.MOD				BENEFIT:You become aware of all mundane attempts to physically hide, cover or alter something near you. You know where someone has tried to hide evidence (such as by bleaching or painting over bloodstains) or conceal tracks. You recognize when someone is wearing a disguise (though you do not automatically see through the disguise) and can see where someone is physically hidden (negating all Hide attempts, even if the person is fully concealed). The rite does not reveal social deceptions (such as when someone tells a lie). You do not automatically pierce supernatural concealing effects but gain a +4 bonus on rolls to do so. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Feet of Mist.MOD				BENEFIT:This rite, which is always active, imposes a 4 penalty on checks to track you by scent. If you spend Essence, this penalty increases to 10 for one hour. You may suppress and reactivate this rite as a free action. - Action=Free   - Cost=0 Essence or 1 Essence - Duration=Instantaneous or 1 hour
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Fog of War.MOD				BENEFIT:You howl with furious unnerving power. All within hearing range take a 10 penalty on attacks, saves and checks. Targets make Will saves (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) the first time they hear you to resist this rite for its entire duration. When you activate this rite, you may designate targets that are immune to it; they must be within sight at the time but can move out of your sight afterward. Maintaining this rite is a standard action, and you cannot use other rites (even those requiring less time than a standard action) while doing so. - Action=Standard (each round you use the rite) - Cost=1 Essence- Duration=Concentration
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Friend of the Dark.MOD			BENEFIT:While in your beast form or hybrid form, you gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet. This rite is always active, although you may suppress and reactivate this rite as a free action. If you spend Essence, the range is 120 feet for one hour. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Essence or 1 Essence - Duration=Instantaneous or 1 hour
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Fuel Rage.MOD				BENEFIT:As a master of controlling the balance of flesh, you can remain in your hybrid form longer than other werewolves. You can activate this rite while in hybrid form. Each time you activate this rite, it extends the maximum duration of your hybrid form; you can activate the rite once per round, possibly greatly extending your time in this form. You can still change form normally; you are just able to linger in hybrid form longer than normal. Activating this rite on a round when you are not in hybrid form or changing into hybrid form has no effect (you cannot activate this rite one round, change to hybrid form the next and still gain the benefit of its extra duration). - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 round per point Wisdom bonus (minimum 1)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Ghost Step.MOD				BENEFIT:You transform yourself, your clothing and small items you carry into a transparent ghostly form resembling a faint mist. Your body volume does not change, and you can fly at Speed 20 (perfect maneuverability). You are invulnerable to physical attacks, but supernatural attacks may still affect you if they do not rely on a physical form or mundane means. (For example, a spell that makes a blade of hard air cannot harm you, and vampire Disciplines that require eye contact cannot harm you, because you have no eyes.) You cannot physically attack  anyone (even another werewolf using this ability) or manipulateany physical object, though you may use rites that affect only yourself. You can change form while in this ephemeral state, though doing so has no effect until you end this rite. You gain a +10 bonus on Hide checks. Your senses are normal despite not having eyes or ears, and you leave no scent and make no sound. You cannot speak, as you have no mouth. Your clothes transform with you, as do one or two objects up to Tiny size. Werewolves using this rite and some other supernatural creatures can see and hear you without penalty. Maintaining this form is taxing. You may remain in it without penalty for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1); each round after that gives you a 4 penalty on attacks, saves and checks. The penalties last for one minute after you return to your normal form. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=Until you end it, plus 1 minute for detrimental effects
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Hone Rage.MOD				BENEFIT:When in hybrid form, you sacrifice one round of remaining time in that form, converting this rage into a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength or Dexterity. You can use this rite only if you have at least one full round available in hybrid form, and the bonuses stack with themselves. (If you have at least two full rounds of hybrid form available, you can sacrifice two rounds to give yourself a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +8 enhancement bonus to Dexterity or a +4 enhancement bonus  to both Strength and Dexterity, and so forth.) These bonusesgo away when you leave hybrid form.Example: Gareth can normally spend four rounds in hybrid form before he has to become human or beast. At the start of the first round in hybrid form, he activates Hone Rage, sacrificing two rounds in hybrid form to increase his Strength and Dexterity by +4. He gets these bonuses all of this round (first round in hybrid form) and the next (second round). At the start of his next turn (on what would have been his third round in hybrid form, had he not sacrificed two rounds of the ability), hereverts to human form and loses the benefits of hybrid form and the temporary Strength and Dexterity boosts from this rite. If he had decided to switch to full beast form rather than human form, he still would lose the additional Strength and Dexterity bonuses from this rite, though he would gain the normal bonuses appropriate to beast form. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=Until you change forms
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Intrusion Cloak.MOD			BENEFIT:You wrap yourself in a shroud of dimensional instability resembling a starry night sky. You gain a +8 bonus on Hide checks. Attempts to identify you take a 4 penalty. Ranged attacks against you suffer a 20%% miss chance. You cannot use Between the Weave, Crash the Gates or Rend the Gauntlet when using this rite. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Invoke the Wind's Wrath.MOD		BENEFIT:You create one whirlwind within 100 feet of you. The whirlwind fills a 10-foot cube and moves at your speed in a direction you indicate. Once directed, the whirlwind is no longer under your control. Any creature the whirlwind touches must make a DC 16 Reflex save or take 2d6 points of damage, and a second Reflex save to avoid being pulled into it and taking this damage every round without a save. A trapped creature cannot escape the whirlwind unless the creature can fly or receives outside aid (such as a rope). Creatures trapped in the whirlwind are carried along with it, taking a 4 penalty to Dexterity and a 2 penalty on attack rolls. A whirlwind can hold as many creatures as can fit inside its space.  The whirlwind lasts two rounds, but you can spend extra Essence to cause the whirlwind to last longer. Any creature trapped in the whirlwind when it dissipates drops to the ground (taking no damage). If two whirlwinds collide, they destroy each other and drop anything they are carrying. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Essence plus 1 Essence for each round you want it to last beyond the first two rounds (spent when you activate the rite) - Duration=2 rounds
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Iron-Rending.MOD				BENEFIT:You treat the hardness of an item as if it were 8 less than normal. To you, stone is as fragile as cloth; iron or steel is no stronger than leather. If the item is a creature's armor, ignore up to eight points of the armor's protection for the purpose of your attack roll. This ability works only on physical items, not magic barriers, force fields and so on. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 round
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Killing Frost.MOD			BENEFIT:You take in a slow breath, drawing the thermal energy out of the area and harmlessly into yourself. Everything in the area takes 3d6 points of cold damage. Frost forms on surfaces, water freezes and the ground becomes icy. Rain may turn briefly into snow or hail (harmless but noisy). The rite affects a spherical area centered on you and extending outward from you to a range of 25 feet plus 25 feet for every Primal Urge rite you have (though you can choose to affect a smaller area). A creature can walk on the icy ground at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means the creature can't move during that round, while failure by 5 or more means the creature falls (see the Balance skill description in Chapter 3: Skills). You do not take damage from this ability, but you are still subject to reduced movement and other secondary effects. This rite may suppress fires in the area for one round if they deal 3d6 points of damage or less; much smaller fires may go out entirely at the GM's discretion. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=Instantaneous (secondary effects such as ice last as long as appropriate for the current weather and temperature)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Lament of the River.MOD		BENEFIT:You cause nearby water to flow to your will. You can use this rite for one of two effects. Wave: You animate a mass of water within 50 feet, causing it to burst forth in a low but strong wave 10 feet wide. The wave moves in a straight line in a direction you indicate (the wave flows around large obstacles such as buildings but otherwise maintains its path) for 50 feet. Creatures and objects the wave strikes take 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and are subject to a bull rush (your check is d20 + your Charisma bonus + 10). Creatures that lose the bull rush check are pushed back five feet for every five points by which the wave won the check, and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be knocked prone. If you use this rite on targets already swimming, they still take damage and may be pushed but are not knocked prone. You cannot use this aspect of the rite if a suitable source of water is not nearby, though the presence of a water tower, swimming pool or even a fire hydrant or city water pipe is sufficient. Flood: By concentrating, you slowly build a connection with the water within one square mile, eventually causing the water to spill out of its confines and rage forth. Make a Will save and subtract your result from 60; this is the number of minutes you must concentrate to create this flood. A flood has the same effect as a wave but on a much larger scale, causing indiscriminate deaths, destruction of property and damage to flora and fauna. (The flood can also put out large fires, scatter an army and so on, so if used properly, this rite may be a mixed blessing rather than a disaster.) Dry areas have less water and suffer less damage as a result; deserts or other extremely dry places may be immune to this rite. You may take a move action each round and maintain concentration, but cannot activate rites or spend Essence. Creatures attuned to the natural world or sensitive to magic or the supernatural can notice your manipulation of the water with a Spot check (DC equal to the number of minutes remaining before the flood occurs); if the creatures beat the check DC by 10, they know your relative direction at that moment. - Action=Standard (wave); consecutive standard (flood) - Cost=1 Essence (wave); or 3 Essence (flood) - Duration=Instantaneous (once triggered), though once you move the water drains and flows at its natural pace as appropriate for the surroundings
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Leach Rage.MOD				BENEFIT:When in hybrid form, you draw in a hissing breath while facing another werewolf in hybrid form, drawing on the energy of her rage to extend your own. The target gets a Will save to resist (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). Failure means the target's available time in hybrid form decreases by one round and yours increases by one round. If the target rolls a 1 on her save, she loses two rounds and you gain two rounds. You cannot steal time in hybrid form that the target does not have; for example, if she has to change form on her next turn (0 rounds remaining in hybrid form), you cannot draw rage from her to extend your hybrid state. You can use this rite on a particular werewolf once per minute, though multiple werewolves with this rite can gang up on a particular werewolf and steal all of her time as a hybrid. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=Until you change forms (the extended duration applies only to your current use of hybrid form, not later transformations)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Legendary Arm.MOD			BENEFIT:You can lift and throw large objects as if they were toys. Use the following table to determine what you can throw and how much damage it deals. Strength Object Size/Weight Damage 110 Human/300 lbs. 2d6 1120 Motorcycle/800 lbs. 3d6 2130 Small car/1,500 lbs. 4d6 3140 Full-size car/2,000 lbs. 5d6 You can throw a typical irregular object as a ranged weapon with a 10-foot range increment. If the item has an aerodynamic shape (even a spheroid boulder), the range increment increases to 20 feet. If you throw the object at something, the object deals the listed damage plus one and a half times your Strength bonus. (In most cases, the object takes as much damage as it deals to the target, though the object's hardness may offset the damage.) You can throw an object so it lands relatively lightly on a surface rather than colliding with it, taking half damage. If you throw a creature this way, she can further reduce the damage by 1d6 by making a Jump or Tumble check (as if she were trying to reduce falling damage). Lifting and throwing objects with this rite is no more taxing than throwing a baseball; the rite augments your Strength to what is necessary and compensates for any strain that the lifting and throwing would cause an unaugmented person. - Action=Standard (includes throwing the item) - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 round
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Loose Tongue.MOD				BENEFIT:You must speak with the target or targets (up to three) for at least five rounds for this ability to work. The targets do not need to have your exclusive attention for this time, and you can selectively affect them out in a crowd of people. Each target gets a Will save to resist (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier, 2 for each target beyond the first). If they fail, you get a +8 bonus on rolls to influence them with Diplomacy, Gather Information, and Sense Motive checks (and rites that rely on these skills). If a target rolls a 1 on his save, he also takes a 4 penalty on Will saves to resist your rites. If the target is in combat or under threat of harm, the rite fails automatically. - Action=Free (speaking is not an action, but you cannot use any other rites while activating this one) - Cost=0 Essence - Duration=10 minutes
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Mask of Rage.MOD				BENEFIT:You reveal your bestial alien spirit, making it obvious that you are not of this world. Any humans who see you must make a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or succumb to fear. Humans are bolstered by the presence of others, so each gets a +1 bonus on her save for every two other humans present (to a maximum of +5). Thus, this ability is less effective against crowds. (You may frighten a dozen people but they are unlikely to run screaming in terror.) The degree of failure affects the witness' actions. Failed By Result 1 to 4 Shaken 5 to 9 Frightened 10 to 14 Panicked 15 to 19 Cowering 20 or more Confused The degree of fear affects the witnesses' memories of the event. Shaken and frightened witnesses may remember a scary person or animal but not specifically what set them off, and may rationalize their fear by making up false details ("he had a gun," "it looked rabid"). Panicked witnesses blot out most memories of the event and rationalize in the most general sense ("I saw the pit bull attack that guy; I don't want to talk about it"). Cowering witnesses remember only glimpses and can't explain what happened at all. Confused witnesses have no memory of the event at all and deny evidence that places them there. This rite does not affect mages, vampires, werewolves or Awakened who know they are Awakened; these supernatural creatures may be momentarily startled by your display, but their awareness of the supernatural precludes this simple effect from bothering them. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Mechanical Failure.MOD			BENEFIT:Though primarily a creature of killing, as a werewolf you also represent more subtle forms of destruction. You cause one mechanical or technological object within five feet to fail without a discernable cause. A gun fails to fire a bullet, a cell phone goes dead, a computer crashes, a car engine stalls or fails to start. If another creature attends the object, the creature makes a Will save to resist (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Mighty Bound.MOD				BENEFIT:You gain a +10 bonus on Jump checks. This ability is always active. - Action=Free (using the Jump skill still is part of your move action) - Cost=0 Essence - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Mortal Savage.MOD			BENEFIT:While in human form, you have low-light vision and a Speed of 40 feet. You can understand werewolf speech while in human form. This ability is always active. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Essence - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Nightfall.MOD				BENEFIT:You release a burst of invisible chaotic energy, preventing electrical devices from functioning. This burst is similar to the electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear weapon except this burst causes no lasting damage and has no harmful side effects; electronic devices simply stop working for no apparent reason. Even battery-powered devices and objects drawing electricity from portable gas-powered generators fail (in fact, the generatorsfail); these devices include cars (which are powered by gas, are started by a battery and rely on an ongoing electrical current to function). This ability affects all electricity-powered devices in approximately a 40-foot-square area, plus additional adjacent areas of that size if you spend more Essence. You must have line of effect to all areas you want to target. Devices brought into the area after you activate the rite function normally. When the duration ends, affected objects function normally (though computers, cell phones and similar items may need a few seconds to start up as if they had just been turned on). Targeting a power plant with this rite has little effect unless you can affect the entire facility, as power plants are designed to be redundant and pick up the slack if one unit fails. - Action=Standard - Cost=1 Essence per area - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Pack Awareness.MOD			BENEFIT:You may make a DC 15 Search check as a free action to get a sense of where your packmates are relative to you, what form they are in (if applicable), what activities they are performing and whether they are wounded, unconscious or dead. A packmate may be "to the left about 100 feet" or "one floor above me in this building." Activities may be "fighting," "waiting," "running," "sleeping," "fleeing," "having sex" and so on. This information comes to you unconsciously and does not distract you from whatever you are doing. A packmate must be within one mile (plus one mile for each Primal Urge rite you have) for you to sense her. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Partial Change.MOD			BENEFIT:Rather than being limited to exactly three forms, you can selectively change one aspect of your body to that of one of your other forms. For example, in human form you can give yourself hybrid-form claws to help you in battle without attracting attention as an obvious monster, or take human hands in beast form to be able to pick a lock or take human eyes in hybrid form to have unhindered color vision. You may make one partial change per round; the change typically affects both the left and right halves of your body, but you may limit it to just one side if you choose. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Essence - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Playing Possum.MOD			BENEFIT:You appear as dead as a corpse, falling prone if you are not already. You evidence no pulse or respiration, and your flesh is cool. Any current wounds seem clotted with dead blood, new wounds do not bleed and you do not react to pain or other stimuli (you still take damage as normal but it appears to be the damage a corpse would suffer). You do not heal while using this rite (though someone can heal you with supernatural abilities). You are aware of your surroundings but cannot move without breaking the effect; you can end it as a free action. Anyone spending at least one round examining you gets a Heal check to recognize you are not actually dead (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). Those using supernatural means to detect life must make this save, although their methods may take less time. - Action=None (you may even activate this when it is not your turn) - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=24 hours or until you end it
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Primal Urge.MOD				BENEFIT:Your maximum Essence increases by 10, and the number of Essence you can spend per round increases by 1. You can remain in hybrid form for one additional round. Your alien spirit is fearsome to humans - even if they don't know you are a werewolf, they can sense that something is horrible and wrong about you. You take a -3 penalty on Diplomacy, Gather Information and Sense Motive checks (or simple Charisma checks) involving peaceful relations with humans; this penalty also applies to rites relying on those checks. This rite has no effect on Intimidate checks. [Special - You may take this rite up to five times. Its effects (bonuses and penalties) stack.]
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Rallying Cry.MOD				BENEFIT:You can howl or speak words of fury as a free action, filling nearby allies with courage. All allies (including yourself) within hearing range gain a +2 morale bonus on attacks, saves and checks. If they (or you) use a humanity point to do something heroic, they have a 25%% chance to retain the humanity point. This rite works only if the targets hear your voice directly; hearing you in a recording or over the phone is insufficient. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Rage Armor.MOD				BENEFIT:You channel your rage, increasing your natural bonus to Defense by +8. This bonus does not apply to silver weapons. When this rite is active, your eyes glow amber and the air around you distorts like the heat from a fire. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Read Intrusion.MOD			BENEFIT:You may make a Search check to study a Nightmare Site or object or creature altered by the Nightmare Wave; you gain supernatural insight as to the Site, object or creature's powers. The result of your Search check determines what you learn about the target. Search Result Information Revealed 10 Basic Nature 20 Fact Basic Nature: If the target is an object, you learn if its taint is generally helpful or harmful and whether this information applies to the bearer of the object or on which it is used (if an object is more than one of these aspects, you learn that fact as well). For example, a coffee cup that heals you if you drink from it but makes you paranoid is both helpful and harmful toward the user. If the target is a location, you learn if staying at the location is generally helpful or harmful (a location may be both). For example, a room that gives you nightmares is harmful, a staircase that temporarily makes you more agile is helpful and a rooftop that lets you fly and gives you brain cancer is both. If the target is a creature, it gets a Will save to resist your scrutiny (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier). Success means you cannot use this ability on the creature for 24 hours. Otherwise, you learn if it is a demon, vampire or werewolf. Fact: You learn one specific fact about the target's supernatural abilities. If the target has multiple abilities, you decide which to learn based on your existing knowledge of the target. For example, if you examine the coffee cup, you decide if you learn the helpful or harmful effect. If the target is a supernatural creature, you learn one of the following (your choice): its approximate power level (in terms of Hit Dice), its most powerful supernatural ability (specific Discipline for a vampire, rite for a werewolf and so on) or its current amount of expendable power (component points for mages, Vitae for vampires and so on). For every 5 points above a Search check result of 20, you learn another fact about the target (one additional fact for 25, two for 30 and so on). Repeat uses of this ability give the same result unless you wait at least 24 hours between each use. (In other words, you can't use this rite twice on two successive rounds to learn two different facts; you have to wait 24 hours to try again.) - Action=Free (though the normal time requirements for Search checks still apply) - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 round
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Rekindle Rage.MOD			BENEFIT:Normally, once you leave hybrid form, you cannot assume it again until 10 minutes have passed, but with this rite, you can take hybrid form again without waiting. You use the normal mechanic of taking hybrid form (take a full-round action, or make a Will save or spend Essence) and your available time in hybrid form is two rounds less than normal (human-form Constitution modifier + number of Primal Urge rites 2, minimum 1). This use of hybrid form is otherwise exactly as a normal use of that form, and you can use rites that rely on hybrid form (such as Hone Rage or Leach Rage) normally. You can continue to use this rite to regain hybrid form as long as you can spend Essence to activate the rite. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=Until you change forms
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Rending the Gauntlet.MOD		BENEFIT:This rite works similar to Crashing the Gates except you do not need to be at a Nightmare Site - you create such a place, focusing your inherent powers of destruction to cut open a doorway in reality. The weak spot you create is temporary and returns to normal once you enter the Gauntlet. Repeat uses of this ability in close physical proximity can cause fatigue over time, eventually creating a new Nightmare Site. - Action=1 full round - Cost=1 Essence per person (including yourself) - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Resist Pain.MOD				BENEFIT:You can temporarily ignore pain and other physical effects that hinder you. You are not numb to all sensation and are still aware if you take damage, but your will overrides your body's limitations. You can ignore the following conditions while you use this rite: dazed, exhausted, fatigued, staggered and stunned. If you are disabled or dying, you may act as if you had at least one hit point (and do not continue to lose hit points while the rite is active). All ignored effects resume as soon as the rite ends. - Action=None (you can activate this ability when it is not your turn, even in response to an attack that causes one of these conditions) - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=10 minutes
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Running Shadow.MOD			BENEFIT:When you make a Move Silently check, you ignore penalties for noisy surfaces and your speed. Moving silently while running through brush is no more difficult than creeping along a smooth concrete floor. - Action=Free (using the Move Silently skill still is part of your move action) - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Sand in the Eyes.MOD			BENEFIT:You can try to affect the target's memory as a free action so she forgets details about you. The target gets a Will save to resist (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). If she fails, the last 10 minutes of her memory are muddled with respect to you; she doesn't remember what you look like, how long you were there or what you were talking about. If she rolls a 1 on her save, she forgets you were there at all. You may affect up to three targets with this rite; each target beyond the first gives each a +2 bonus on the save. If you attack a target, the effect ends immediately for her. This rite affects only memories for the last 10 minutes before you use it; if you interacted with the target at an earlier time, those memories are intact, though she may not realize her clouded memories are of the person she knows from earlier. You can use this rite on a particular target only once every 10 minutes, even if she makes her save. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Essence - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Savage Might.MOD				BENEFIT:You gain a +10 enhancement bonus to Strength. This bonus stacks with itself if you spend multiple Essence in one round. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence per +10 bonus to Strength - Duration=1 round
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Savage Rending.MOD			BENEFIT:Your claws deal +4 points of damage. This bonus stacks with itself. You can end the effect as a free action. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute or until you end it
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Scent Beneath the Surface.MOD	BENEFIT:After observing a target for one round, you gain a keen insight into the meaning of her words, body language and even th secret leanings of her heart. Unless she has supernatural means to conceal these facts, you immediately know if she is lying outright, lying by omission, speaking the truth in a misleading way or is being deliberately evasive. You can also determine the target's overall emotional state no matter how she tries to conceal or disguise it. This rite does not reveal the truth behind the target's lies, but you can often figure it out from context and her method of falsehood. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Sense Weakness.MOD			BENEFIT:You learn a specific weakness of the target, such as a powerful vice, a mental disorder or a physical flaw such as poor eyesight or a limp. The target resists with a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier); if she rolls a 1 on her save, you learn two weaknesses instead of one. The GM determines what weakness or weaknesses you learn. You can use this rite on a particular creature once per day. Each time you use this rite, you learn a different weakness (if any). - Action=Standard - Cost=0 Essence - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Silver Jaws.MOD				BENEFIT:Your teeth and claws become metallic silver, capable of harming a werewolf just as easily as any silver weapon. This change has no effect in human form (though you look like you painted your nails and have a grill or braces) unless you use a rite such as Partial Change to turn your puny human hands or teeth into something more dangerous. The silver transformation does not harm you (though someone could make you scratch yourself with your claws, which would). You gain a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks against creatures vulnerable to silver. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Skin-Stealing.MOD			BENEFIT:This rite lets you grow a fleshy skin over your own skin, emulating the scent and appearance of someone whose flesh you have tasted. This skin is separate from your own, but fits perfectly. The skin appears real - it is warm, sweats, expands as you move and breathe and your blood flows through the skin when it is cut - and it masks your scent. The rite changes your size to match the assumed skin, even if the guise is of someone much larger or smaller than you. Your own ability scores do not change. This rite works only on people, not on animals. The skin gives you a +8 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as the appropriate person. As the skin does not change your voice or cover your eyes or orifices, an alert observer who knows the subject may more easily recognize the difference. You cannot adopt the skin of a vampire or other undead creature. If you change form, the skin tears and falls off (ending the disguise) unless the skin is of another werewolf. You may discard the skin as a standard action. The skin decays into unidentifiable dust within a few minutes, as do pieces of it taken from you. - Action=Standard - Cost=2 Essence if the skin is of a werewolf, otherwise 1 Essence - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Slip Away.MOD				BENEFIT:You slip out of any physical bond, leaving the item behind unharmed and unchanged (rope still tied, handcuffs locked and so on). If you are in a grapple, you can use standard action to automatically escape as if you had successfully used the Escape Artist skill or broken the grapple by winning an opposed grapple check. This rite does not work on binding supernatural effects, mundane bindings supernaturally enhanced for this purpose or on enclosed spaces such as prison cells, car trunks or footlockers. - Action=Free or standard (if used to escape a grapple) - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=Instantaneous
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Snarl of Command.MOD			BENEFIT:With an ugly snarl and a few harsh words, you force the target to reveal the simple truth about a topic you are discussing. She may resist with a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). This revelation usually involves answering a single question following your use of the rite, or you may force her to remove a disguise or reveal her supernaturally concealed true form (if the concealment is something she controls). She cannot reveal truths she does not know, and she is not otherwise forced to obey your commands. If she rolls a 1 on her save, she reveals the complete truth as best she knows it regarding your question, even providing details you may not have guessed. You don't have to know that the target is lying before using this rite, but it has no effect if the target has been truthful and compliant with your questioning (nor does it force her to lie in an act of contrariness). You must be face-to-face with the target. You can use this rite on a specific person only once per day. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 round (or one minute if the target rolls a 1 on her save)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Speak with Beasts.MOD			BENEFIT:You may speak normally with an animal and it understands you, and you understand its responses as well. What an animal can tell you is limited by its intelligence and awareness. The animal is under no obligation to listen to or agree with you (though bribing it with food helps). Most animals are fearful of werewolves, and this fear affects their behavior. - Action=Free - Cost=0 Essence, or 1 Essence if you want to affect up to 10 animals at the same time slip away  two world eyes - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Two-World Eyes.MOD			BENEFIT:You shift the vision in one eye so that it becomes hypersensitive to the Intrusion; this eye turns completely black while you use this ability. You may make a DC 20 Search check to recognize Nightmare Sites and objects or creatures (including demons, werewolves and vampires but not mages or Awakened) that are strongly affected by the Nightmare Wave or the Intrusion - to your sight these things appear distorted from their "real" forms, sometimes gaining subtle features related to their new abilities. For example, an old house that eats the souls of anyone who sleeps within it might look like a giant face with two hollow "eyes" (windows) and a gaping "mouth" (door), a rifle that poisons anyone it shoots might look like a stiffened snake and a vampire might look like a withered corpse. Sometimes, the Intrusion-afflicted shape may not be clear or indicative of what has happened to it; the house, rifle or vampire might look a little blurry, have a dark halo or just look wrong. Some Intrusion-tainted things may be harder to detect (DC 30 or higher). You retain normal vision in your other eye. This duality of senses does not cause you any discomfort or give you any other penalties or benefits (for example, a sudden bright light can still blind you just as easily). - Action=Standard - Cost=0 Essence - Duration=1 minute
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Unspoken Communication.MOD		BENEFIT:You link the minds of your packmates, allowing them to communicate instantly and silently with each other or you by thought alone. They can "hear" each other perfectly clearly despite physical noise, and may send their mental "voice" to just one or all simultaneously. You can link only packmates who are in your sight when you activate the rite. They do not need to see you or each other (you are the "hub" for the communication). Once you activate the rite, affected packmates may pass out of your sight without breaking the effect. Because they can quickly coordinate their efforts, when two or more packmates attack the same creature, each gets a +4 circumstance bonus on attack rolls. - Action=Free - Cost=1 Essence. After the start of the link, you may add other packmates to the mental network (for example, if they were out of sight when you started) by spending one Essence. - Duration=1 minute. You may continue the effect for another minute by spending one Essence (without requiring your packmates to be in sight).
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Vanish.MOD					BENEFIT:You vanish, becoming invisible. No form of sense that relies on light (including heat sensors, ultraviolet detectors and other forms of light outside the human visual range) can detect you, though this rite is not proof against nonvisual methods such as vibration or scent. You can attack while invisible. If you take damage, you must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + damage taken) to remain invisible. See Chapter 7: Playing the Game, "Special Abilities," Invisibility, for more information. - Action=Free - Cost=2 Essence - Duration=1 minute, or until broken or until you end it - Duration=1 round
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Ward.MOD					BENEFIT:You mark the boundary of your territory by urinating on objects at its perimeter. This creates a scent-mark backed by supernatural power, which affects predators and humans. Any natural predator that wants to enter your territory must make a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) to do so. Most avoid these areas, not liking competition. A predator brought into your territory against its will has no penalties but tries to leave as soon as possible. The ward triggers a primal flight instinct in humans, causing feelings of fear and dread. Any human who tries to enter the warded area must make a Will save (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or become panicked and flee. If she is brought into your territory against her will, she cowers. Other werewolves and supernatural creatures that can follow scents (even if they require supernatural means to do it) sense this boundary but can breach it without a roll. In this regard, the ward is a warning that you are willing to kill to protect your territory. Supernatural creatures without a strong sense of smell (such as most Awakened) don't detect the ward and may break it without a roll. You can mark an area up to one square mile plus an additional square mile for every Primal Urge rite you have. The ward fails if your territory already contains 10 or more different types of significant predators per square mile (such as a zoo) or a large concentration of humans (such as a city); in such cases you can only ward a smaller area (such as a cave, an alley or rarely used parking lot). You can also mark a single creature with this rite (and urine), signifying that the creature is under your protection (or perhaps as prey with which you don't want others to interfere). A marked creature does not trigger a fear reaction in humans the way a boundary does. - Action=None (the entire process takes about an hour per square mile marked) - Cost=0 Essence - Duration=1 lunar month
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Warning Growl.MOD			BENEFIT:You glare at the target and issue a growl of warning. The target gets a Will save to resist (DC 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). Failure means you gain a +6 dodge bonus to Defense against that target. - Action=Move - Cost=1 Essence - Duration=1 minute
