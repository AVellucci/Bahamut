Horrific Form							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality											DESC:A demon is an alien spirit, and when it takes form in our world the spirit naturally reshapes its inanimate host material into the closest Earth-approximation of its energy self. Because the demon is from a distant dimension unlike ours, this 'natural form' is invariably hideous to behold. Each demon's natural form is unique, and those humans who know of demons' existence use these shapes to identify demons. If killed, a demon reverts to whatever inert matter its spirit used to create its body. This matter holds the last shape the dead demon had before it was killed. If you kill a demon, its corpse is a crude statue of glass, earth, wood, plastic or whatever its body was really made of, roughly approximating the demon's shape at the time of death.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.
Fear									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality											DESC:Any creature clearly seeing a demon's true form must make a Will save DC %1 or become shaken.|BaseDemonDC																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.
Shapechanging							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality											DESC:Changing shape is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Demons can change shape, taking on the appearance of any human or humanlike creature (elf, lizard-man, 'little green man' alien, typical devil with horns and a tail and so on) of Small or Medium size (or Large size, if combined with the Great Stature cant). The change is only cosmetic; the demon does not get any special powers of the new form (turning into Dracula doesn't give the demon the powers of a vampire) and retains its own ability scores. The demon can even imitate a specific person (as a disguise or deception), though the change is not detailed enough to duplicate fine details such as fingerprints, voice scans and retina scans; this sort of disguise gives the demon a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pretend to be that person. Although shapechanging is easy for a demon, it is taxing. A demon can stay in a form other than its true form for up to one hour, after which the demon reverts to its true form and must remain that way for an hour. Shorter periods of shapechanging require shorter recovery periods (equal to the time spent in another form or 10 minutes, whichever is greater). The demon can change from one human form to another without assuming its true form in between, as long as the total time spent out of its true form is one hour or less.|PREVAREQ:Shapechanging,0	DESC: Changing shape is a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Demons can change shape, taking on the appearance of any human or humanlike creature (elf, lizard-man, 'little green man' alien, typical devil with horns and a tail and so on) of Small or Medium size (or Large size, if combined with the Great Stature cant).

Mage Components	KEY:MageComponents		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	DEFINE:Components|0	DESC:%1|Components															SOURCEPAGE:p.
Spells		KEY:Mage ~ Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																							SOURCEPAGE:p.	BENEFIT:Spells are mages' weapons, armor and universal tools. Mages build spells as a mason builds walls out of bricks - piece by piece, with units called components. At low levels, a mage has few components at his disposal, but at higher levels, he can cast dozens of weak spells or several great spells in the course of a day. Components are divided into categories such as Range, Heal and Illusion. For more information on building and casting spells, see Chapter 5: Magic.
Rotes			KEY:Mage ~ Rotes			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																							SOURCEPAGE:p.	BENEFIT:A rote is a codified spell; mages have cast it many times and know how to do so for the best possible effect. A starting mage knows all the rotes in this book (see Chapter 5: Magic, "Rote Spells") and gains a bonus on Spellcraft checks to cast certain rotes for which his path has affinity.
Spell Affinity	KEY:Mage ~ Spell Affinity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																							SOURCEPAGE:p.	BENEFIT:Mages are skilled practitioners of magic; they can tap their power to enhance their ability to concentrate or understand magic. A mage can spend components to modify Concentration or Spellcraft checks; each component adds a +1 bonus on one check. Components spent this way do not add to the spell's exhaustion rating. A mage does not need to choose a component category from which to spend these components. You don't need to specify that these are Range or Heal components; just mark them off from your daily total. These components are used up whether or not the roll succeeds. Using this ability does not require an action; it is just a natural part of using the skill, and you can even use it when it is not your turn. You must decide whether to spend components, and how many to spend, before you make the Concentration or Spellcraft check.

Vampire Resistance to Damage	OUTPUTNAME:Resistance to Damage	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality										DESC:A critical hit against you merely stuns rather than dealing Constitution damage. You do not bleed. If you take enough damage to be in a dying state makes checks to recover but never loses hit points from failed checks.	DESC:You do not need to breathe	DESC:Immune to normal poisons and disease.																																																							VISION:Low-light	SOURCEPAGE:p.
Deathsleep										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality										DESC:Every day at dawn, a vampire feels an urge to rest in a sleep indistinguishable from death. She may spend one Vitae to resist this urge and remain awake through the day. A sleeping vampire can still spend Vitae to heal herself. To awaken at sundown, a vampire spends one Vitae. A sleeping vampire with no Vitae to spend remains trapped in sleep until someone feeds her or several months pass and she spontaneously awakens, wasted away to nearly nothing (10 hit points) and ravenous with hunger. Some vampires believe that more powerful vampires trapped this way take longer to awaken.											SOURCEPAGE:p.
Sunlight Vulnerability								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality										DESC:A vampire fully exposed to sunlight takes four points of Constitution damage on his turn each round of exposure. Partial exposure does proportionately less damage. Certain Disciplines may reduce or increase this damage.																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.
Undead										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality										DESC:Vampires are unliving bodies powered by Vitae. While this state has its advantages, unlike living things, vampires do not heal from rest and time, and they do not benefit from standard medical attention (such as the Heal skill). To heal, a vampire must spend Vitae.																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.

They do not automatically know the other vampire's clan or abilities, but the undead spirits recognize their kindred death and hunger for the living. You know if another vampire is weaker than you (two or more levels below), stronger (two or more levels above) or about at about the same level of power.

###Block: Werewolf -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Ability Name		Unique Key				Output Name			Category of Ability		Type				Define									Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	Weapon prof. bonus					Source Page		Natural Attacks
Shapechanging		KEY:Werewolf Shapechanging					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality											DESC:You can channel your alien spirit into your flesh, reshaping meat and bone. You have two nonhuman forms: a completely bestial form and a hybrid form that mixes its human and bestial shapes. Changing form is a full-round action, though you can change as a free action if you make a DC 15 Will save, or spend one Essence to do it without a roll																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Beast Form												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack											DESC:The bestial form more closely resembles the werewolf's alien form rather than an Earth wolf or dog (only an idiot would mistake a beast form werewolf as a real wolf in anything but dim light). In beast form, the werewolf's Dexterity and Constitution increase by +2, his speed increases to 40 feet, he gains a bite attack, gains a +8 bonus on Listen and Spot checks and gains the scent ability. While in beast form, a werewolf cannot speak human languages, but he can communicate with other werewolves in beast form or hybrid form. (Even a werewolf's human ears cannot make out werewolf speech.) A werewolf in beast form cannot use the Diplomacy or Gather Information skills except on other werewolves. The beast form cannot see color. While in beast form, a werewolf has low-light vision, and can see twice as far as a normal human in conditions of low light.																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.76
Hybrid Form												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack											DESC:The hybrid form is powerful but unstable, both physically and mentally. The hybrid form is bipedal and tall, covered in hair the color of the human form's, has opposable thumbs and can speak human languages and the werewolf language. The hybrid form has Bite/Claw/Claw. The hybrid form has good hearing (+4 bonus on Listen checks) and sight but limited color vision (+4 bonus on Spot checks except when color vision is important). The werewolf's Strength and Dexterity increase by +4 and Constitution increases by +2. While in hybrid form, a werewolf has low-light vision, and can see twice as far as a normal human in conditions of low light. The hybrid form is a being of pure rage; the werewolf can barely manage the clarity to speak (DC 20 Will save to bark out a few words). The werewolf cannot use Charisma-, Dexterity- or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate and Ride), the Concentration skill or any abilities that require patience or concentration or rites (unless the rite specifies otherwise). He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise. Every round on his turn, a hybrid-form werewolf must attack or move toward an enemy; if the werewolf can't see a living foe, he has to strike out at something nearby (a car, fallen foe and so on). He can still discern friend from foe, fallen foes from living ones, and can decide between multiple available foes. To do anything other than move, attack or activate an allowed rite (even to exit hybrid form), the werewolf must make a DC 20 Will save.									SOURCEPAGE:p.76

Pack Mentality											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality											DESC:Werewolves feel most comfortable in groups, whether this group is composed of werewolves or other powerful creatures. Werewolves have the mystical ability to forge a special bond with up to four other creatures, which the werewolf calls his 'pack.' Inviting someone into a pack takes a full-round action and must be done in the presence of the potential packmate. A werewolf with four packmates who wants to add another must first release one (a free action) before inviting a replacement. A creature (werewolf or otherwise) can be in only one pack at a time. A packmate is a trusted kin; forcing a packmate to harm another is nearly impossible (doing so is like trying to force someone to harm himself). Some werewolves learn supernatural powers (called rites) that work only on packmates.																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.77
Hardiness												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality											DESC:A werewolf's alien soul enhances the werewolf's human metabolism, making it immune to normal sickness and disease. The werewolf is still vulnerable to magical diseases and poison.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.77
Sprint Healing											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality											DESC:A werewolf has sprint healing 5/20 (Heal up to 5 hp a rnd, up to 20 hp in a day)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.77

Silver Vulnerability										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality											DESC:In hybrid or beast form takes double damage from silver up to 5 points. Sprint healing cannot heal the extra damage from silver.
