# Barbarian Class Feature
Level 1: Combat Expertise	KEY:Combat Expertise ~ Barbarian	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BarbarianClassFeature.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality		DESC:Your ferocity and battle talent make you a deadly combatant. Benefit: You gain the following features. &nl;Weapon Attack Bonus: You gain a +1 bonus to your attack roll when you're using a weapon with which you have proficiency. This bonus increases as you gain levels, as noted on the Barbarian table. &nl;Martial Damage Dice: You gain a single martial damage die, a d6. As you gain levels, you gain additional martial damage dice, as noted on the Barbarian table. When you hit a target with a melee or ranged attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, you can spend any of your martial damage dice to deal extra damage. Roll those dice, and add their total to the damage dealt by that attack. You regain your spent martial damage dice at the start of each turn, whether it's your turn or someone else's. Some feats grant maneuvers, which are fueled by martial damage dice. If you know a maneuver, you can spend your martial damage dice on it, rather than on extra damage, provided nothing is preventing you from taking actions. &nl;Martial Damage Bonus: At higher levels, you gain a bonus to weapon damage rolls. At 7th level, the bonus is +5. It increases as you gain levels, as noted on the Barbarian table. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee or ranged attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, you can add your martial damage bonus to the attack's damage against that creature.
