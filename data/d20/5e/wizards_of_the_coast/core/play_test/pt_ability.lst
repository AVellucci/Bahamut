Each of those creatures gains a +2 bonus to melee damage rolls, and any damage the creature takes is reduced by its Constitution modifier.

Level 18: Unchecked Fury	KEY:Unchecked Fury ~ Barbarian	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BarbarianClassFeature.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC: When an opponent foils your attack, you can tap into your latent fury to lash out with a kick, punch, or head butt, but at the cost of committing your effort wholly to this strike.

###Block: Cleric Class Feature
Level 1: Spellcasting		KEY:Spellcasting ~ Cleric		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods themselves, flowing from them into the world. As a cleric, you are a conduit for that power. You combine your will with your deity's and manifest it as miraculous effects. The gods do not grant this power lightly or to everyone who seeks it, but only to those they choose to fulfill a high calling of service to their aims. Harnessing and channeling divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. You might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but ultimately your ability to cast cleric spells relies on your intuitive understanding of your deity's wishes, your ability to attune yourself to the god's presence, and your zeal to impose your combined wills on the world. Benefit: You can cast a number of cleric spells per day based on the number of spell slots you receive for your cleric level, as noted in the Cleric Spells per Day table. You can also cast cantrips, which you gain from the Deity feature. Wisdom is your magic ability score. Spell Preparation: You must prepare your spells before casting them. After a long rest, you regain all your spell slots, and you can prepare a number of spells by spending time in prayer. You can prepare a number of spells equal to 1 + your cleric level, choosing any spell you wish from the cleric spells you can cast. You will usually want to prepare at least one spell of each level you can cast. Preparing your spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least one minute per spell level for each spell you prepare. Casting a Spell: When you cast a spell, choose one of your prepared spells and use a spell slot of that spell's level or higher. Some spells have improved effects when they are cast at higher levels. After you cast the spell, you lose the use of that slot until you prepare spells again, but you still have the spell prepared. You can use your spell slots to cast any combination of spells you have prepared, as long as you respect the limit on spells you can cast of a specific level. For example, if you have bless and cure wounds prepared and have two 1st---level spell slots available, you can cast each spell once or cast one of those spells twice. Rituals: You can cast any spell you have prepared as a ritual, provided that the spell has a ritual version. Saving Throw DCs: When a cleric spell that you cast calls for a saving throw, the save DC equals 10 + your Wisdom modifier + the spellcasting bonus for your level, as noted in the Cleric table.
Level 1: Channel Divinity	KEY:Channel Divinity ~ Cleric		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:You have the ability to perform miracles by acting as a conduit for raw divine power. When you do so, you channel energy directly from your deity, using it to fuel exceptional magical effects. Benefit: You can channel divinity once per day. Your deity choice determines how you can channel divinity. As you gain levels, you gain additional uses of this feature each day, as noted in the Cleric table. When you channel divinity, you choose an option granted by your deity and gain its benefits. Each channel divinity option explains how to use it. Here are the most common options.

# Channel Divinity Options
Disappearing Trick	KEY:Disappearing Trick ~ Channel Divinity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As an action, you can expend a use of your channel divinity to become invisible until the start of your next turn.

Choose an undead creature within 25 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to your spell save DC). On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you for 1 hour, even if that creature cannot normally be charmed. While charmed by you, the creature must obey your verbal commands. You cannot charm an undead creature whose Hit Dice are greater than your cleric level. If you are at least 11th level and you rebuke an undead creature that is mindless, the charm effect is permanent.
Restore Health		KEY:Restore Health ~ Channel Divinity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As an action, you can expend one of your uses of channel divinity to send positive energy into a living creature.

When you do so, each undead creature within 25 feet of you that has hit points equal to or less than twice your cleric level is destroyed. Each remaining undead creature within 25 feet of you that has hit points equal to or less than five times your cleric level is turned. A turned creature is affected for 1 minute or until it takes damage from an attack or a spell. It must spend its turns trying to get as far away from you as it can. It cannot willingly move within 25 feet of you (unless there is nowhere else it can move), it cannot take reactions, and it can use its actions only to hustle or to try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
#
Level 1: Deity	KEY:Deity ~ Cleric		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The deity you serve or the philosophical system you adopt grants you access to divine magic and is the source of the magical energy you need to cast spells. Your dedicated service to your deity or philosophy is what makes you a cleric, and this service influences not just your capabilities but the core of your being. Benefit: Choose a deity from the options presented in this section. (Your DM might offer different or additional options.) Your choice of deity grants you various special abilities, including spells that are associated with the god's domain of influence. If you have a domain spell that does not appear on the cleric's spell list, the spell is, nonetheless, a cleric spell for you. The deity choices are iconic appellations rather than specific deity names. Depending on your DM's campaign, these deities might have many different names. In effect, each deity presented here is a template that can be used for a number of gods from myth and various D&D worlds. Similarly, a given deity from myth or from a D&D setting could encompass multiple options from this section. Your choice might reflect a focus on only one aspect of that deity, which might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to that deity. Thus, two clerics serving the same sun god might make different choices for the purpose of this class feature. One character might choose the Lightbringer option and another could choose the Protector option, assuming both options relate to the same god.

# Diety Selection
The Arcanist	KEY:The Arcanist ~ Diety		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:In a world rife with magical power and populated by wizards, dragons, and other magical beings, the Arcanist is the god who shepherds, teaches, and sometimes even embodies that power. This god is often also a deity of knowledge and learning, but in some pantheons those domains are separate. The nature and personality of the Arcanist typically reflects a culture's attitude toward the practice of magic-a kindly Arcanist reflects a positive view of the role of magic in the world where wizards are often kindly sages, while an Arcanist who is grim and secretive might emerge in a culture where magic is shunned or outlawed, practiced by witches and dark sorcerers. Hecate of the Olympian pantheon is a dark expression of the Arcanist. In the Pharaonic pantheon, Isis is an Arcanist revered at a popular level with countless charms and prayers, while Thoth, as god of knowledge, also represents the hidden mysteries of the universe, the understanding of which is expressed as magical power. In the Asgardian pantheon, Odin sacrificed an eye to gain the same kind of knowledge of hidden mysteries, while Freya is the goddess of enchantments and illusions. Mystra is the goddess of magic in the FORGOTTEN REALMSR pantheon, whose essence is the Weave that provides magic to the world, and Azuth is patron of wizards specifically. Among the gods of GREYHAWKR, Boccob is a god of knowledge and magic, while Wee Jas is a darker god of death and necromancy. The DRAGONLANCER pantheon has three gods of magic, corresponding to the three moons: good Solinari, neutral Lunitari, and evil Nuitari. These three gods are rarely worshiped, however. The Arcanist is most often neutral, but can have any alignment depending on the deity's attitude toward magic.
The Lifegiver	KEY:The Lifegiver ~ Diety		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The Lifegiver takes a variety of forms, all of them involving growth, fertility, and healing. This deity is usually female and is sometimes an earth mother, a forest sprite, or a great ocean or river. The Lifegiver might appear as Demeter of the Olympian pantheon, Isis of the Pharaonic pantheon, Frigga of the Asgardian pantheon, Chauntea of the FORGOTTEN REALMS, Beory of GREYHAWK, or Mishakal of DRAGONLANCE. As a devotee of life, you can foster health and healing in the people you attend. Your prayers can cause wounds to close and sickness to fade. Your divine patron urges you to cleanse the world of suffering and to provide aid to those in need. Life springs up and blooms around the paragons of your faith. Stories tell of blessed clerics who live for centuries without suffering aches, ills, or the ravages of age. Some are said to be able to heal with a glance, to cause withered crops to spring back to life where they walk, and to dull the physical and emotional pain of anyone who sees them. The Lifegiver is most often lawful good, neutral good, or chaotic good.
The Lightbringer	KEY:The Lightbringer ~ Diety		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The Lightbringer is a sun deity, whose followers are infused with radiant light and the power of the sun's searing heat. This deity is sometimes the ruler of a pantheon and is often portrayed as the sun itself or a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. The sun's daily course means that the Lightbringer can embody principles of rebirth or renewal, but some sun deities are the sun at high noon, looking down upon the mortal world to pronounce judgment and burn away evil. The Lightbringer models Apollo of the Olympian pantheon, Re---Horakhty of the Pharaonic pantheon (also called Ra or Horus---Re), Frey and Odur of the Asgardian pantheon, Pelor and Pholtus of GREYHAWK, and Lathander and Amaunator of the FORGOTTEN REALMS. The Lightbringer entrusts you with the sun's power so you can become a beacon of light in a darkened world. You bring light wherever you go, chasing away shadows and burning away darkness. Your prayers can bring forth sunlight, which you might focus into burning rays or let loose to shine its wholesome light. The most devoted and enlightened followers of the Lightbringer shine with their own inner light. Creatures of darkness and death cower in the presence of the mightiest of your faith, unable to bear the brightness of their countenance. The Lightbringer is most often lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good, or lawful neutral.
The Protector	KEY:The Protector ~ Diety		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The Protector is a god of defensive strength, an unyielding force that guards against the forces of evil. Sometimes the Protector is a martial deity, usually male, who stands as the ideal for sentinels and paladins. Other times the Protector is primarily a god of community, often female, who embodies the community's cohesiveness and responsibility to protect and care for each other. Examples of the first aspect include Athena of the Olympian pantheon, Heimdall of the Asgardian pantheon, Heironeous or Mayaheine of GREYHAWK, Helm of the FORGOTTEN REALMS, Paladine of DRAGONLANCE, and Moradin, god of dwarves. Examples of the community aspect of the Protector include Hestia of the Olympian pantheon, Hathor of the Pharaonic pantheon, Frigga of the Asgardian pantheon, Eldath of the FORGOTTEN REALMS, Berei or Merikka of GREYHAWK, and Yondalla, goddess of halflings. The Protector entrusts you with the strength and endurance to protect the innocent so that you can become a beacon of hope in a darkened world. You protect the weak from the wicked, and nothing stirs your righteous fury so much as witnessing harm brought to those your god calls you to protect. The most devoted and enlightened followers of the Protector are bulwarks of defense in a violent world. Many seek to take the fight to the enemy, delving into dungeons to root out threats before they can spread. On the edge of civilization, the Protector's clerics organize defenses, train local militias, and bring justice to a lawless land. The Protector is most often lawful good, neutral good, or lawful neutral.
The Reaper		KEY:The Reaper ~ Diety		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A figure of grim countenance and sinister reputation, the Reaper is a deity of death, the end of the cycle of life, and the decay of all things. This deity is typically a creature of doom and evil and often a patron of necromancers and the undead, but in some pantheons the Reaper merely represents the natural end of life and is an enemy of the undead. The Reaper is analogous to Hel of the Asgardian pantheon, Hades of the Olympian pantheon, Anubis or Osiris of the Pharaonic pantheon, Myrkul or Kelemvor of the FORGOTTEN REALMS, Nerull or Wee Jas of GREYHAWK, or Morgion of DRAGONLANCE. As a follower of the Reaper, you spread the power of death through the land. If you are not evil, you tend to the dead and dying, ensuring that their souls pass to their rightful rewards. If you are evil, you raise the undead to do your bidding, and you spread fear and death wherever you go. Clerics of the Reaper can spread death with a touch, claiming the souls of the weak in their deity's name. The undead cow before their might, and they face either a swift destruction or a compulsion to obey the cleric's dictates. The Reaper is most often neutral, lawful neutral, or neutral evil.
The Stormcaller	KEY:The Stormcaller ~ Diety		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The ferocious Stormcaller is a deity of thunder, lightning, and storms, and often also of war, physical might, and courage. Most often, the Stormcaller is a barbaric deity, commonly male, with a fury and physical prowess to match the raw power of the storm. In some pantheons, the Stormcaller is a ruler of the gods whose domain is the whole sky, and who is often known for swift, violent justice delivered via thunderbolt. In the pantheons of seafaring people, the Stormcaller is often an ocean deity and patron of sailors. Zeus of the Olympian pantheon is an example of a Stormcaller who rules the gods and the sky, while Thor of the Asgardian pantheon is the headstrong son of the sky god. Set of the Pharaonic pantheon is a god of destructive storms, while the FORGOTTEN REALMS pantheon includes three "Gods of Fury" who rule storms: Talos the Storm Lord, Auril the Frostmaiden, and Umberlee the Sea Queen. Like Umberlee, Procan of GREYHAWK and Zeboim of DRAGONLANCE are sea deities who are appeased to abate the fury of storms. As a follower of the Stormcaller, you call down lightning and thunder to smite your foes. The most accomplished followers of the Stormcaller command storms. Good clerics of the Stormcaller are tireless champions who wage war against evil. In comparison, the evil aspect of the Stormcaller is a bully whose followers dominate the weak and defenseless. The Stormcaller is most often chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil.
The Trickster	KEY:The Trickster ~ Diety		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The Trickster is a god of trickery and thieves, a mischief---maker and instigator who stands as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. Unlike most other deities, the Trickster is often portrayed as an animal, such as a raven or a fox, as well as a shapechanger who can adopt any form at will. The Trickster is often also a god of luck, either good or bad. Examples of the Trickster include Hermes of the Olympian pantheon, Bes of the Pharaonic pantheon, Loki of the Asgardian pantheon, Beshaba or Tymora of the FORGOTTEN REALMS, Olidammara or Zagyg of GREYHAWK, and Garl Glittergold, god of gnomes. As a follower of the Trickster, you see the world as a grand game, which you play to get what you want. Subterfuge, pranks, and theft are often the tools you use, rather than direct confrontation. Of all the deities, the Trickster covers the widest moral ground. A chaotic good expression of the Trickster is a liberator and freedom fighter. The evil form of the Trickster delights in murder and wealth gained by any means. Standing in the middle of these two extremes, the chaotic neutral expression of this god is a capricious free spirit. The Trickster is most often chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil.
The Warbringer	KEY:The Warbringer ~ Diety		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:War has many manifestations. It can be glorious, making heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, mortals' worst traits writ large on the battlefield, with acts of cruelty, malice, and cowardice eclipsing those instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the Warbringer watches over warriors and rewards them for great bravery. Many pantheons have two gods that fill the role of the Warbringer, representing opposite ideals of warfare: Athena and Ares of the Olympian pantheon, the brothers Heironeous and Hextor of GREYHAWK, and Tyr and Tempus of the FORGOTTEN REALMS. The Warbringer attracts a wide range of individuals. You might be a courageous hero, a bold champion who inspires others to fight the good fight. Or you might see the battlefield as your temple and offer violence as prayers to your deity. Whatever your connection to warfare, you excel in battle and improve those who fight at your side. Paragons of your faith grow more and more like the deity they serve or the ideal of warfare they uphold. Most tales of the legendary followers of the Warbringer portray them as powerful generals or war chiefs, leading hordes in conquest or mustering armies to drive off invaders. They are often said to inspire courage or berserk fury in those who fight beside them. The shout of such a cleric can strike terror in enemies, and tales are told of battles won without a single blow struck, as armies quailed and fled before the wrath of a mighty champion of the Warbringer.

Level 1: Spellcasting		KEY:Spellcasting ~ Druid			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DruidClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As a druid, you learn divine spells through prayer and ancient rites and draw on the primal strength of nature itself. You use this power to protect the wilderness, driving away those who would despoil it and fortifying those who would protect it. Benefit: You can cast a number of druid spells per day based on the number of spell slots you receive for your druid level, as noted in the Druid Spells per Day table. You can also cast cantrips. Wisdom is your magic ability. Cantrips: Your choice of druid circle determines the cantrips available to you. Spell Preparation: You must prepare your spells before casting them. After a long rest, you regain all your spell slots, and you can prepare a number of druid spells equal to 1 + your druid level. You can choose any spell from the druid's spell list, provided you can cast druid spells of that level. You will usually want to prepare at least one spell of each level you can cast. Preparing your spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least one minute per spell level for each spell you prepare. Casting a Spell: When you cast a spell, choose one of your prepared spells and use a spell slot of that spell's level or higher. Some spells have improved effects when they are cast at higher levels. After you cast the spell, you lose the use of that slot until you prepare spells again, but you still have the spell prepared. You can use your spell slots to cast any combination of spells you have prepared, as long as you respect the limit on spells you can cast of a specific level. For example, if you have entangle and animal friendship prepared and have two 1st--- level spell slots available, you can cast each spell once or cast one of those spells twice. Rituals: You can cast any druid spell you have prepared as a ritual, provided that the spell has a ritual version. Saving Throw DCs: When a druid spell that you cast calls for a saving throw, the save DC equals 10 + your Wisdom modifier + the spellcasting bonus for your level, as noted in the Druid table.
Level 1: Druid Lore		KEY:Druid Lore ~ Druid				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DruidClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:The wilderness is your home. You have acquired the skills needed to survive off the land. Benefit: You have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall natural lore. In addition, you know the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden signs for other druids. A hidden sign is a written message up to twenty words long.

Level 1: Wild Shape		KEY:Wild Shape ~ Druid				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:DruidClassFeature.ClassFeature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A druid learns that life is an elaborate web of energy that binds all creatures together. This knowledge allows you to assume new forms simply by using your magic to express your life energy in a new way. Benefit: Once per day, you can use your action to magically transform into another creature. Alternatively, you can transform as part of another action, provided that action doesn't involve casting a spell or activating a magic item. As you gain levels, you gain additional uses of this feature per day, as noted in the Druid table. At 1st---level, you have access to the shape of the hound. As you gain levels, you gain additional shapes that you can change into, as noted in the Druid table. When you transform, you choose from the creature options available to you and assume that creature's shape for a number of hours equal to your Constitution modifier + your druid level (minimum of 2 hours), after which time you revert to normal (use your Constitution modifier, not the creature's). You can use your action to revert to your normal shape earlier. You automatically revert to normal if you drop to 0 hit points or fewer or if you die. While you are in the creature's shape, the following rules apply. . Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature. You retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. . Transforming into or out of the creature's shape has no effect on your hit points, even if the shape's Constitution score is different from yours. . You cannot cast spells or take any other actions that require hands or speech. Transforming does not break your concentration, however, on a spell you cast beforehand. . Your gear is subsumed by the creature's shape, so you cannot access it. You cannot activate a magic item on your person, but a magic item that confers a passive effect, such as a ring of protection, continues to do so.
