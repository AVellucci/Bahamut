Low-Light Vision	SOURCEPAGE:p.	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Vision	DEFINE:LowLightDistance|2	DESC:You can see %1x as far as humans in low illumination. Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-light vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light.

Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise-invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.|DarkvisionRange																																																																																																																																																																					VISION:Darkvision (DarkvisionRange)			ASPECT:Vision|Darkvision %1'|DarkvisionRange

This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. For example, a human barbarian has a speed of 40 feet, rather than 30 feet, when wearing light or no armor. When wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load, his speed drops to 30 feet. A halfling barbarian has a speed of 30 feet, rather than 20 feet, in light or no armor. When wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load, his speed drops to 20 feet.

He temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are; see Temporary Hit Points, page 146.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies; see below). A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action (see Initiative, page 136), not in response to someone else's action. A barbarian can't, for example, fly into a rage when struck down by an arrow in order to get the extra hit points from the increased Constitution, although the extra hit points would be of benefit if he had gone into a rage earlier in the round, before the arrow struck 
Uncanny Dodge			SOURCEPAGE:p.26	KEY:Uncanny Dodge ~ Barbarian			TYPE:Extraordinary		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.BarbarianClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class (a barbarian with at least four levels of rogue, for example), he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
Trap Sense				SOURCEPAGE:p.26	KEY:Trap Sense ~ Barbarian			TYPE:Extraordinary		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.BarbarianClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
Improved Uncanny Dodge		SOURCEPAGE:p.26	KEY:Improved Uncanny Dodge ~ Barbarian	TYPE:Extraordinary		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.BarbarianClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked; he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.
Damage Reduction			SOURCEPAGE:p.26	KEY:Damage Reduction ~ Barbarian		TYPE:Extraordinary		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.BarbarianClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level, a barbarian gains the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from each blow or attack. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.
Greater Rage			SOURCEPAGE:p.26	KEY:Greater Rage ~ Barbarian			TYPE:Extraordinary		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.BarbarianClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.
Indomitable Will			SOURCEPAGE:p.26	KEY:Indomitable Will ~ Barbarian		TYPE:Extraordinary		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.BarbarianClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.
Tireless Rage			SOURCEPAGE:p.26	KEY:Tireless Rage ~ Barbarian			TYPE:Extraordinary		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.BarbarianClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.
Mighty Rage				SOURCEPAGE:p.26	KEY:Mighty Rage ~ Barbarian			TYPE:Extraordinary		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.BarbarianClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 20th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at -2. 

# Bard
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Bard	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). Because the somatic components required for bard spells are relatively simple, a bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.
Bardic Knowledge			KEY:Bardic Knowledge ~ Bard			SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A bard picks up a lot of stray knowledge while wandering the land and learning stories from other bards. He may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.) A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random. The DM can determine the Difficulty Class of the check by referring to the table above.
Bardic Music			KEY:Bardic Music ~ Bard				SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies (fa-la-la, and so forth), whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks. Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that doesn't require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just as for casting a spell with a verbal component (see Components, page 174), a deaf bard has a 20%% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.
#
Countersong	TYPE:Supernatural			KEY:Countersong ~ Bardic Music		SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself ) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack (such as a sound burst or command spell) may use the bard's Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for the save. Countersong has no effect against effects that don't allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.
Fascinate	TYPE:SpellLike			KEY:Fascinate ~ Bardic Music			SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability (two at 4th level, three at 7th level, and so on). To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.
Inspire Courage	TYPE:Supernatural		KEY:Inspire Courage ~ Bardic Music		SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himself ), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.
Inspire Competence	TYPE:Supernatural		KEY:Inspire Competence ~ Bardic Music	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally. Depending on the task that the ally has at hand, the bard may use his bardic music to lift the ally's spirits, to help him or her focus mentally, or in some other way. The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard's music. The DM may rule that certain uses of this ability are infeasible-chanting to make a rogue move more quietly, for example, is self-defeating. The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can't inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability.
Suggestion	TYPE:SpellLike			KEY:Suggestion ~ Bardic Music			SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not break the bard's concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the fascinate effect. Making a suggestion doesn't count against a bard's daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard's level + bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see mass suggestion, below). Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability.
Inspire Greatness	TYPE:Supernatural		KEY:Inspire Greatness ~ Bardic Music	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells such as sleep. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.
Song of Freedom	TYPE:SpellLike		KEY:Song of Freedom ~ Bardic Music		SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the break enchantment spell (caster level equals the character's bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can't use song of freedom on himself.
Inspire Heroics	TYPE:Supernatural		KEY:Inspire Heroics ~ Bardic Music		SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, allowing that creature to fight bravely even against overwhelming odds. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.
Mass Suggestion	TYPE:SpellLike		KEY:Mass Suggestion ~ Bardic Music		SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:BardClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:This ability functions like suggestion, above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the suggestion simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already fascinated (see above). Mass suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.

# Cleric
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Cleric		SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields (except tower shields). Every deity has a favored weapon (see Deities, page 106), and his or her clerics consider it a point of pride to wield that weapon. A cleric who chooses the War domain receives the Weapon Focus feat related to that weapon as a bonus feat. He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category. See Chapter 5: Feats for details.

Clerics who don't worship a specific deity but choose the Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain have a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.

Spells				KEY:Spells ~ Cleric					SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A cleric casts divine spells (the same type of spells available to the druid, paladin, and ranger), which are drawn from the cleric spell list (page 183). However, his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below). To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric's spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric's Wisdom modifier. Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 3-7: The Cleric. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8). A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see Deities, Domains, and Domain Spells, below). Clerics do not acquire their spells from books or scrolls, nor do they prepare them through study. Instead, they meditate or pray for their spells, receiving them through their own strength of faith or as divine inspiration. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Typically, this hour is at dawn or noon for good clerics and at dusk or midnight for evil ones. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list (page 183), provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.
Spontaneous Casting		KEY:Spontaneous Casting ~ Cleric			SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can "lose" any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name). For example, a good cleric who has prepared command (a 1st-level spell) may lose command in order to cast cure light wounds (also a 1st-level spell). Clerics of good deities can cast cure spells in this way because they are especially proficient at wielding positive energy. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), on the other hand, can't convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with "inflict" in its name). A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player's choice), depending on whether the cleric is more proficient at wielding positive or negative energy. Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or commands undead (see below). Exceptions: All lawful neutral clerics of Wee Jas (goddess of death and magic) convert prepared spells to inflict spells, not cure spells. All clerics of St. Cuthbert (god of retribution) and all nonevil clerics of Obad-Hai (god of nature) convert prepared spells to cure spells, not inflict spells.
Turn or Rebuke Undead		KEY:Turn or Rebuke Undead ~ Cleric			SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClericClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures (such as skeletons, zombies, ghosts, and vampires) by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159). A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures., forcing them to cower in awe of his power. If your character is a neutral cleric of a neutral deity, you must choose whether his turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once you make this choice, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see above). Exceptions: All lawful neutral clerics of Wee Jas (goddess of death and magic) rebuke or command undead. All clerics of St. Cuthbert (god of retribution) and all nonevil clerics of Obad-Hai (god of nature) turn of destroy undead. A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.

# Druid
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Druid	SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.DruidClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below). Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the ironwood spell description, page 246) Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones. A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spelllike class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.
Spells				KEY:Spells ~ Druid				SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.DruidClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A druid casts divine spells (the same type of spells available to the cleric, paladin, and ranger), which are drawn from the druid spell list (page 189). Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below). To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier. Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 3-8: The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page8). She does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does. A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place (but see Spontaneous Casting, below). A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list (page 189), provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.
Spontaneous Casting		KEY:Spontaneous Casting ~ Druid		SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.DruidClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast any summon nature's ally spell of the same level or lower. For example, a druid who has prepared repel vermin (a 4th-level spell) may lose repel vermin in order to cast summon nature's ally IV (also a 4th-level spell).
Animal Companion	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Animal Companion ~ Druid			SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.DruidClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the DM's campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the DM may add the following creatures to the druid's list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind. A 1st-level druid's companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted in the sidebar on page 36. As a druid advances in level, the animal's power increases as shown on the table in the sidebar. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished. A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals (see the sidebar). Should she select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character's druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character's druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the table in the sidebar to determine the animal companion's powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or lower, she can't have that animal as a companion.) For example, a 6th-level druid could select a leopard as an animal companion. The leopard would have characteristics and special abilities as if the druid were 3rd level (taking into account the -3 adjustment) instead of 6th level.
Nature Sense	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Nature Sense ~ Druid			SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.DruidClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.
Wild Empathy	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Wild Empathy ~ Druid			SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.DruidClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A druid can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (such as a bear or a monitor lizard). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4: Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (such as a basilisk or a girallon), but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.
Woodland Stride	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Woodland Stride ~ Druid			SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.DruidClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.
Trackless Step	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Trackless Step ~ Druid			SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.DruidClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.
Resist Nature's Lure	TYPE:Extraordinary	KEY:Resist Nature's Lure ~ Druid		SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.DruidClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey (such as dryads, pixies, and sprites).
Wild Shape	TYPE:Supernatural			KEY:Wild Shape ~ Druid				SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.DruidClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type (see the Monster Manual). This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with. For example, a druid who has never been outside a temperate forest could not become a polar bear. A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.) A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, as noted on Table 3-8: The Druid. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level. The new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level. For instance, a druid can't take the form of a dire bear (a Large creature that always has at least 12 HD) until 12th level, even though she can begin taking Large forms at 8th level. At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant creature, such as a shambling mound, with the same size restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can't use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or a rose bush.) At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental's feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature type (humanoid, in most cases). At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.
Venom Immunity	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Venom Immunity ~ Druid			SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.DruidClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.
A Thousand Faces	TYPE:Supernatural		KEY:A Thousand Faces ~ Druid			SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.DruidClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell (page 197), but only while in her normal form.
Timeless Body	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Timeless Body ~ Druid			SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.DruidClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging (see Table 6-5: Aging Effects, page 109) and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.
# Animal Companion
Bonus Tricks			KEY:Bonus Tricks ~ Animal Companion		SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The value given in this column is the total number of "bonus" tricks that the animal knows in addition to any that the druid might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill, page 74). These bonus tricks don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don't count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. The druid selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can't be changed.
Link	TYPE:Extraordinary				KEY:Link ~ Animal Companion			SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A druid can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion.
Share Spells	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Share Spells ~ Animal Companion		SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At the druid's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts upon herself also affect her animal companion. The animal companion must be within 5 feet of her at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the animal companion if the companion moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the animal again, even if it returns to the druid before the duration expires. Additionally, the druid may cast a spell with a target of "You" on her animal companion (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A druid and her animal companion can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type (animal).
Evasion	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Evasion ~ Animal Companion		SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.
Devotion	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Devotion ~ Animal Companion		SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:An animal companion's devotion to its master is so complete that it gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.
Multiattack				KEY:Multiattack ~ Animal Companion		SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks (see the Monster Manual for details on this feat) and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second attack with its primary natural weapon, albeit at a -5 penalty.
Improved Evasion	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Improved Evasion ~ Animal Companion	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an animal companion takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.

Bonus Feats				KEY:Bonus Feats ~ Fighter				SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.FighterClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The fighter gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every two fighter levels thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats on Table 5-1: Feats (page 90). A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums. (See Chapter 5: Feats for descriptions of feats and their prerequisites.) These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels (see Table 3-2: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits, page 22). A fighter is not limited to the list of fighter bonus feats when choosing these feats.

# Monk
Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Monk	SOURCEPAGE:p.40		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Monks are proficient with certain basic peasant weapons and some special weapons that are part of monk training. The weapons with which a monk is proficient are club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and sling. (See Chapter 7: Equipment for descriptions of these weapons.) Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields-in fact, many of the monk's special powers require unfettered movement. When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.
AC Bonus	TYPE:Extraordinary				KEY:AC Bonus ~ Monk				SOURCEPAGE:p.40	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A monk is highly trained at dodging blows, and she has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks. When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level). These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.
Flurry of Blows	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Flurry of Blows ~ Monk			SOURCEPAGE:p.40	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. The resulting modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of Blows Attack Bonus column on Table 3-10: The Monk. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make before her next action. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must use a full attack action (see page 143) to strike with a flurry of blows. When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk weapons interchangeably as desired. For example, at 6th level, the monk Ember could make one attack with her unarmed strike at an attack bonus of +3 and one attack with a special monk weapon at an attack bonus of +3. When using weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus ? 1-1/2 or ? 1/2) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The monk can't use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows. In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse unarmed strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so. For example, an 8th-level monk could make two attacks with the quarterstaff (one with each end) at a +5 attack bonus and one with an unarmed strike at a +0 attack bonus, or she could attack with one end of the quarterstaff and one unarmed strike each at a +5 attack bonus, and with the other end of the quarterstaff at a +0 attack bonus, or she could attack with one end of the quarterstaff and one unarmed strike at a +5 attack bonus each, and with the other end of the quarterstaff at a +0 attack bonus. She cannot, however, wield any other weapon at the same time that she uses a quarterstaff. When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.
Unarmed Strike				KEY:Unarmed Strike ~ Monk			SOURCEPAGE:p.41	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Monks are highly trained in fighting unarmed, giving them considerable advantages when doing so. At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes. Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling. A monk's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons (such as the magic fang and magic weapon spells). A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table 3-10: The Monk. The unarmed damage on Table 3-10 is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.

Bonus Feat					KEY:Bonus Feat ~ Monk				SOURCEPAGE:p.41	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may select either Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may select either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. (See Chapter 5: Feats for descriptions.) A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.		DEFINE:MonkFeatCount|0		DEFINE:MonkBonusFeatLVL|0
Evasion	TYPE:Extraordinary				KEY:Evasion ~ Monk				SOURCEPAGE:p.41	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A monk of 2nd level or higher can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a fireball), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk (such as one who is unconscious or paralysed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Fast Movement	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Fast Movement ~ Monk			SOURCEPAGE:p.41	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed, as shown on Table 3-10. A monk in armor (even light armor) or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.
Still Mind	TYPE:Extraordinary				KEY:Still Mind ~ Monk				SOURCEPAGE:p.41	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment, since her meditation and training improve her resistance to mind-affecting attacks.
Ki Strike	TYPE:Supernatural				KEY:Ki Strike ~ Monk				SOURCEPAGE:p.41	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction (see Damage Reduction, page 291 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Ki strike improves with the character's monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness (see Smashing an Object, page 165).
Slow Fall	TYPE:Extraordinary				KEY:Slow Fall ~ Monk				SOURCEPAGE:p.41	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk's ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her descent and fall any distance without harm. See the Special column on Table 3-10 for details.
Purity of Body	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Purity of Body ~ Monk			SOURCEPAGE:p.41	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, a monk gains control over her body's immune system. She gains immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases (such as mummy rot and lycanthropy).
Wholeness of Body	TYPE:Supernatural			KEY:Wholeness of Body ~ Monk			SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out among several uses.
Improved Evasion	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Improved Evasion ~ Monk			SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a dragon's breath weapon or a fireball, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monk (such as one who is unconscious or paralysed) does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
Diamond Body	TYPE:Supernatural				KEY:Diamond Body ~ Monk				SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 11th level, a monk is in such firm control of her own metabolism that she gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.
Abundant Step	TYPE:Supernatural			KEY:Abundant Step ~ Monk			SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell dimension door, once per day. Her caster level for this effect is one-half her monk level (rounded down).
Diamond Soul	TYPE:Extraordinary				KEY:Diamond Soul ~ Monk				SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level; see Spell Resistance, page 177) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.
Quivering Palm	TYPE:Supernatural			KEY:Quivering Palm ~ Monk			SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.
Timeless Body	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Timeless Body ~ Monk			SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Upon attaining 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her time is up.					TEMPLATE:Timeless Body
Tongue of the Sun and Moon	TYPE:Extraordinary	KEY:Tongue of the Sun and Moon ~ Monk	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.
Empty Body	TYPE:Supernatural				KEY:Empty Body ~ Monk				SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day, as though using the spell etherealness. She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.
Perfect Self				KEY:Perfect Self ~ Monk				SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.MonkClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 20th level, a monk has tuned her body with skill and quasi-magical abilities to the point that she becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider (an extraplanar creature) rather than as a humanoid for the purpose of spells and magical effects. For instance, charm person does not affect her. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction (see Damage Reduction, page 291 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.

# Paladin
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Paladin	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).
Aura of Good	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Aura of Good ~ Paladin	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the detect good spell) is equal to her paladin level, just like the aura of a cleric of a good deity.
Detect Evil	TYPE:SpellLike			KEY:Detect Evil ~ Paladin	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell.
Smite Evil	TYPE:Supernatural			KEY:Smite Evil ~ Paladin	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. For example, a 13th-level paladin armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+13 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses for high Strength or magical affects that would normally apply. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day. At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 3-12: The Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.
Divine Grace	TYPE:Supernatural			KEY:Divine Grace ~ Paladin	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.
Lay on Hands	TYPE:Supernatural			KEY:Lay on Hands ~ Paladin	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level ? her Charisma bonus. For example, a 7th-level paladin with a 16 Charisma (+3 bonus) can heal 21 points of damage per day. A paladin may choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn't have to use it all at once. Using lay on hands is a standard action. Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead creature.
Aura of Courage	TYPE:Supernatural		KEY:Aura of Courage ~ Paladin	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.
Divine Health	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Divine Health ~ Paladin	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases (such as mummy rot and lycanthropy).
Turn Undead	TYPE:Supernatural			KEY:Turn Undead ~ Paladin	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of three levels lower would. (See Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159.)
Spells				KEY:Spells ~ Paladin		SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells (the same type of spells available to the cleric, druid, and ranger), which are drawn from the paladin spell list (page 191). A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, Wis 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a paladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin's Wisdom modifier. Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 3-12: The Paladin. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8). When Table 3-12 indicates that the paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 4th-level paladin), she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level The paladin does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does. A paladin prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to spontaneously cast a cure spell in its place. A paladin may prepare and cast any spell on the paladin spell list (page 191), provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation. Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is one-half her paladin level.
Special Mount	TYPE:SpellLike		KEY:Special Mount ~ Paladin	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin gains the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil (see the sidebar). This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin). Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount from the celestial realms in which it resides. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's class level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin and remains for 2 hours per paladin level; it may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The mount is the same creature each time it is summoned, though the paladin may release a particular mount from service (if it has grown too old to join her crusade, for instance). Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed (including barding, saddle, saddlebags, and the like). Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect. Should the paladin's mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. The paladin may not summon another mount for thirty days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first, even if the mount is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the paladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.
Remove Disease	TYPE:SpellLike		KEY:Remove Disease ~ Paladin	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 6th level, a paladin can produce a remove disease effect, as the spell, once per week. She can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth).
Code of Conduct			KEY:Code of Conduct ~ Paladin	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, a paladin's code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.
Associates				KEY:Associates ~ Paladin	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.PaladinClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful good.
# Paladin Special Mount
Empathic Link	TYPE:Supernatural		KEY:Empathic Link ~ Special Mount		SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialMountAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The paladin has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The paladin cannot see through the mount's eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Note that even intelligent mounts see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are always possible. Because of this empathic link, the paladin has the same connection to an item or place that her mount does, just as with a master and his familiar (see Familiars, page 52).
Improved Evasion	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Improved Evasion ~ Special Mount	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialMountAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.
Share Spells			KEY:Share Spells ~ Special Mount		SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialMountAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At the paladin's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount. The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again even if it returns to the paladin before the duration expires. Additionally, the paladin may cast a spell with a target of "You" on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A paladin and her mount can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the mount's type (magical beast).
Share Saving Throws		KEY:Share Saving Throws ~ Special Mount	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialMountAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the paladin's, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any other bonuses on saves that the master might have (such as from magic items or feats).
Improved Speed	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Improved Speed ~ Special Mount		SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialMountAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:The mount's speed increases by 10 feet.
Command	TYPE:SpellLike			KEY:Command ~ Special Mount			SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialMountAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Once per day per two paladin levels of its master, a mount can use this ability to command other any normal animal of approximately the same kind as itself (for warhorses and warponies, this category includes donkeys, mules, and ponies), as long as the target creature has fewer Hit Dice than the mount. This ability functions like the command spell, but the mount must make a DC 21 Concentration check to succeed if it's being ridden at the time (in combat, for instance). If the check fails, the ability does not work that time, but it still counts against the mount's daily uses. Each target may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin's level + paladin's Cha modifier) to negate the effect.
Spell Resistance	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Spell Resistance ~ Special Mount	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SpecialMountAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A mount's spell resistance equals its master's paladin level + 5. To affect the mount with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level; see Spell Resistance, page 177) that equals or exceeds the mount's spell resistance.

# Ranger
Weapon and Armor Proficiency						KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Ranger		SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).

Favored Enemy			TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Favored Enemy ~ Ranger		SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility	DESC:At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on Table 3-14: Ranger Favored Enemies. Due to his extensive study on his chosen type of foe and training in the proper techniques for combating such creatures, the ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures. At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2. For example, a 5th-level ranger has two favored enemies; against one he gains a +4 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks and weapon damage rolls, and against the other he has a +2 bonus. At 10th level, he has three favored enemies, and he gains an additional +2 bonus, which he can allocate to the bonus against any one of his three favored enemies. Thus, his bonuses could be either +4, +4, +2 or +6, +2, +2. If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy (for instance, devils are both evil outsiders and lawful outsiders), the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher. See the Monster Manual for more information on types of creatures.	DEFINE:FavoredEnemyBase|2		DEFINE:FavoredEnemies|0	DEFINE:FavoredEBonuses|0
Track										KEY:Track ~ Ranger			SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility	DESC:A ranger gains Track (see page 101) as a bonus feat.
Wild Empathy			TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Wild Empathy ~ Ranger		SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility	DESC:A ranger can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (such as a bear or a monitor lizard). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see page 72). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (such as a basilisk or a girallon), but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.
Combat Style			TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Combat Style ~ Ranger		SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility	DESC:At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice affects the character's class features but does not restrict his selection of feats or special abilities in any way. If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
Endurance									KEY:Endurance ~ Ranger			SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility	DESC:A ranger gains Endurance (see page 93) as a bonus feat at 3rd level.
Animal Companion			TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Animal Companion ~ Ranger		SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility	DESC:At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the DM's campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the DM may add the following creatures to the ranger's list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. (For instance, an aquatic creature can't adventure with a ranger on land and shouldn't be selected by a nonaquatic character without extenuating circumstances). In most cases, the animal companion functions as a mount, sentry, scout, or hunting animal, rather than as a protector. This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name (see page 35), except that the ranger's effective druid level is one-half his ranger level. For example, the animal companion of a 4th-level ranger would be the equivalent of a 2nd-level druid's animal companion. A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level. Thus, he must be at least an 8th-level ranger to select from the druid's list of 4th-level animal companions, and if he chooses one of those animals, his effective druid level would be reduced by 3, to 1st level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an alternative animal if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.
Improved Combat Style		TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Improved Combat Style ~ Ranger	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility	DESC:At 6th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot feat (page 97), even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat (page 96), even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
Woodland Stride			TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Woodland Stride ~ Ranger		SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility	DESC:Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him.
Swift Tracker			TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Swift Tracker ~ Ranger		SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility	DESC:Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.
Evasion				TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Evasion ~ Ranger			SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility	DESC:At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a fireball), he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ranger (such as one who is unconscious or paralysed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Combat Style Mastery		TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Combat Style Mastery ~ Ranger	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility	DESC:At 11th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Precise Shot feat (page 96), even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat (page 95), even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
Camouflage				TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Camouflage ~ Ranger			SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility	DESC:A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.
Hide in Plain Sight		TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Hide in Plain Sight ~ Ranger	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.RangerClassAbility	DESC:While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Hide skill even while being observed.

# Rogue
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Rogue		SOURCEPAGE:p.50		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.RogueClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.																																																																																																																					AUTO:FEAT|Simple Weapon Proficiency	AUTO:FEAT|Armor Proficiency (Light)																															ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|All Automatic Proficiencies|Rogue Weapon Proficiencies
Sneak Attack			KEY:Sneak Attack ~ Rogue				SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.RogueClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Basically, the rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. (See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for combat situations in which the rogue flanks an opponent or the opponent loses his Dexterity bonus to AC.) Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. A rogue can't strike with deadly accuracy from beyond that range. With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in order to execute a sneak attack. (See Nonlethal Damage, page 146.) A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment (see page 152) or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.
Trapfinding				KEY:Trapfinding ~ Rogue					SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.RogueClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.
Evasion	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Evasion ~ Rogue					SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.RogueClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a fireball), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue (such as one who is unconscious or paralysed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Trap Sense	TYPE:Extraordinary			KEY:Trap Sense ~ Rogue					SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.RogueClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level. Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
Uncanny Dodge	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Uncanny Dodge ~ Rogue				SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.RogueClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class (a rogue with at least two levels of barbarian, for example), she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
Improved Uncanny Dodge	TYPE:Extraordinary	KEY:Improved Uncanny Dodge ~ Rogue			SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.RogueClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked; she can react to opponents on opposite sides of her as easily as she can react to a single attacker. This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
Special Abilities			KEY:Special Abilities ~ Rogue				SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.RogueClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.
# Special Abilities Selections
Crippling Strike	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Crippling Strike ~ Rogue Special Abilities	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.RogueClassAbility.SpecialQuality.RogueSpecialAbilitySelection	DESC:A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.
Defensive Roll	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Defensive Roll ~ Rogue Special Abilities	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.RogueClassAbility.SpecialQuality.RogueSpecialAbilitySelection	DESC:The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll- if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.
Improved Evasion	TYPE:Extraordinary		KEY:Improved Evasion ~ Rogue Special Abilities	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.RogueClassAbility.SpecialQuality.RogueSpecialAbilitySelection	DESC:This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a dragon's breath weapon or a fireball, henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless rogue (such as one who is unconscious or paralysed) does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

# Sorcerer
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Weapon and Armor Proficiency ~ Sorcerer	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SorcererClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer's arcane gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.																																																																																																												AUTO:FEAT|Simple Weapon Proficiency																																					ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|All Automatic Proficiencies
Spells				KEY:Spells ~ Sorcerer					SOURCEPAGE:p.54	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SorcererClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A sorcerer casts arcane spells (the same type of spells available to bards and wizards), which are drawn primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell list (page 192). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see below). To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 3-16: The Sorcerer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8). A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells (also called cantrips) and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 3-17: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table 3-17 are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list (page 192), or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. For example, a sorcerer with a scroll or spellbook detailing an unusual sorcerer/wizard spell (one not on the sorcerer/wizard spell list in this book) could select that spell as one of his new spells for attaining a new level, provided that it is of the right spell level. The sorcerer can't use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however. Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer spell the sorcerer can cast. For instance, upon reaching 4th-level, a sorcerer could trade in a single 0-level spell (two spell levels below the highest-level sorcerer spell he can cast, which is 2nd) for a different 0-level spell. At 6th level, he could trade in a single 0-level or 1st-level spell (since he now can cast 3rd-level sorcerer spells) for a different spell of the same level. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. For example, at 1st level, the sorcerer Hennet can cast four 1st-level spells per day-three for being 1st level (see Table 3-16: The Sorcerer), plus one thanks to his Charisma score of 15 (see Table 1- 1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8). However, he knows only two 1st-level spells: magic missile and sleep (see Table 3-17: Sorcerer Spells Known). Thus, on any given day, he can cast some combination of the two spells a total of four times. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he'll cast.
Familiar				KEY:Familiar ~ Sorcerer					SOURCEPAGE:p.54	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.SorcererClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:A sorcerer can obtain a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant. The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power. If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer's experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal. For example, suppose that Hennet is a 3rd-level sorcerer with 3,230 XP when his owl familiar is killed by a bugbear. Hennet makes a successful saving throw, so he loses 300 XP, dropping him below 3,000 XP and back to 2nd level (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules for losing levels). A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs. A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.

Scribe Scroll			KEY:Scribe Scroll ~ Wizard			SOURCEPAGE:p.57	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.WizardClassAbility	DESC:At 1st level, a wizard gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. This feats enables her to create magic schools (see Scribe Scroll, page 99, and Creating Magic Items, page 282 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Bonus Feats				KEY:Bonus Feats ~ Wizard			SOURCEPAGE:p.57	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassAbility.WizardClassAbility.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. (See Chapter 5 for descriptions of feats and their prerequisites.) These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets every three levels (as given on Table 3-2: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits, page 22). The wizard is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing these feats.
Spellbooks				KEY:Spellbooks ~ Wizard				SOURCEPAGE:p.57	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.ClassAbility.WizardClassAbility	DESC:A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells (see Preparing Wizard Spells, page 177). She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic, which all wizards can prepare from memory. A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from her prohibited school or schools, if any; see School Specialization, page 57) plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8), the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wizard level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wizard level) for her spellbook. For example, when a wizard attains 5th level, she can cast 3rd-level spells. At this point, she can add two new 3rd-level spells to her spellbook, or one 2nd-level spell and one 3rd-level spell, or any combination of two spells between 1st and 3rd level. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards' spellbooks to her own (see Adding Spells to a Wizard's Spellbook, page 178).	TEMPLATE:Spellbook
